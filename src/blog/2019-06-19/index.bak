Today marks four months of Aurelia's treatment with Baricitinib. When this started, we were given the expectation that it might take this long to know whether Auri would tolerate this drug and respond to it favorably. Since then, we've been to Duke every two weeks and subjected her to constant blood draws and lab work. Well... it _has_ gone well enough and we're celebrating this milestone and spacing out her followups moving forward.

However, the past few months may not have gone as well as I had hoped they would at the start, but I didn't really have any idea what was reasonable. Now that I know more, I shouldn't be anything but thankful and hopeful that Auri remains healthy. In actuality, I remain conflicted and struggle with anxiety. Auri is _happy_ and _healthy_, but far from _safe_. I couldn't make it to her most recent appointment, but Natalie relayed a question of mine to Dr. K. I asked, "what's the next milestone?" She replied that "there aren't any." We're in the uncomfortable position of celebrating progress while having little information about what to expect in the future. Despite this, I remain hopeful. This drug undeniably halted her regression, and Auri has gone four months without any sign of relapse. While I've been terrified by every blip or change, be it cell counts fluctuating or changes in Auri's strength or attitude; she's been stable. In some admittedly rare cases, this disease isn't entirely devastating. There seems to be an environmental aspect to it, whether you suffer a trigger or illness of a certain magnitude at the wrong time. With an effective drug to help her and any luck in avoiding triggers, this _could_ have been the worst of it for Auri. Natalie and I certainly hope so, and we're focusing less on her disease and more now on her development.

## Germs and Dominos
Families with multiple kids seem to watch them get sick in succession. In our family the kids seem to take each other down one after the other like dominos. Just a few weeks ago, Lennox woke me in the middle of the night vomiting. He spent the weekend sleeping on the floor in the bathroom with a fever. The following weekend, the same happened to Max (including sleeping in the bathroom). Max seemed to have it a bit worse, with a fever that peaked at 104 after a few days. I spent about two weeks checking temperatures in the middle of the night and trying to shield Natalie and Auri from getting sick. While I wasn't entirely successful, neither Auri nor Natalie seemed to have it as bad during the third and final weekend. Unfortunately, Auri did get a bit sick and developed an eye infection. Although we all seemed to have some eye redness and itchiness, this is the second time that Auri has developed puffy eyes and more significant conjunctivitis.

The important part about this, though, is how it relates to Auri's milestone. We've been sick multiple times, and Auri has had fevers. With her disease and treatment, you worry a lot about whether any of these illnesses will develop into something severe or trigger a regression. Thus far, we haven't witnessed anything significant. With the exception of the eye infections, she's passed through them no worse than the rest of us. She gets tired and weak when sick, but her strength and coordination is more fragile now.

## Progress
I believe Natalie and I share different perspectives about the progress we've witnessed. I personally think it's best to describe this less as progress and more as stability. Realistically, any major changes in Auri's physical abilities will take an extended period of time and lots of therapy. We expect her to gain some skills and independence, but it will be on a time frame that gets measured in quarters or years. In these four months, though, we've seen some changes and improvements that I hope lay the foundation for the future. In short, she's re-developed some strength and particularly where she needs it.

### Therapy and Neurological Improvements
Natalie and I probably overanalyze changes here. While we're relatively confident that she's been improving, I'm not entirely sure what version of Auri to compare to. Towards the end of January she was still crawling. On January 30th, we could [prop her in front of some toys](https://photos.app.goo.gl/QD7G8qMuUHh1XRVg9) and she showed more strength than she has now. In the beginning of February I remember there being some really scary moments, but on February 5th she was [reading a book on the couch](https://photos.app.goo.gl/roM8ocAscE7afr9e9) and on February 12th she was [eating a popsicle](https://photos.app.goo.gl/AmSjBnNNku9oPjdF8) pretty well. Auri in February doesn't look all that different from Auri now.

Today, you can watch her [walking in the Hallway](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gfnQrzE8iC5moMPD7), [playing in the grocery cart](https://photos.app.goo.gl/NLPoxrj1Xd6pXCLY9), and [swinging at the playground](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uFspcjRdAFTHAwCw6). You can see for yourself that she has challenges, but many children with her disease would find these activities impossible.

The past two weekends I spent the entire morning with Auri. Waking up last week, she kept saying "buh" and to my surprise pointed with an almost perfectly extended index finger. This is a subtle but important thing because she started to lose fine control of her hands just about when she started treatment. She's extremely inconsistent about it right now, and she seems to be best in the morning. When she's _really_ calm she uses a modified pincer grasp and keeps her hands open. When she's not, she rakes at things with a clawed hand to pick them up.

### Growth and Vitals
These charts are a little subtle; forgive me. I'm hoping that somebody in the same position as Natalie and I earlier this year reads these posts and draw conclusions about 

#### Length
This length chart tells a story that only Natalie and I would immediately understand. You can see how inconsistent the measurements are, and it's a result of how spastic Auri's legs became. It's difficult to measure her length carefully because she has trouble relaxing her feet and legs when she's stressed. You can imagine that she doesn't like laying on a table with people trying to push her. I don't know what this chart will look like in the future, but it's very likely that Auri has suffered some growth delays. I imagine that recovery here would take a bit more time, but I don't think we've observed anything serious.

#### Weight

Before this chaos _really_ began, we had taken Auri to her pediatrician at the start of the year with our concerns. At that appointment we learned that she remained the same exact weight as the month prior. That's a bad sign for any child, and for Auri it was a signal that something was terribly wrong. There's a big dip in Auri's weight chart at 15 months, right when shit really hit the fan. This was *just* before starting treatment, when she was choking on food and water and suffered the worst of her regressions. She was persistently sick and got very thin. She went as low as the 13th percentile. Four months later, she's eating and drinking better and holding the 30th percentile. Within the first few weeks of treatment she became enthusiastic about eating and regained a lot of weight.

#### Blood Pressure

When we first entered the Duke system, Auri had consistently high blood pressure. It was regularly high enough that we performed a kidney ultrasound and echocardiogram to rule out pulmonary hypertension and kidney disease. It's hidden a bit in ths chart, but her blood pressure has normalized since starting treatment.
