I&apos;ve begun to share a lot more regularly across those platforms. If you follow me on Instagram (IG &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pcw216/&quot;&gt;@pcw216&lt;/a&gt;) you can basically watch us in real time. I&apos;m also trying something new with photo collages, and, while perusing our photos of the last few months, I&apos;m amazed at how busy we&apos;ve been. Most of these pictures were taken in the last month, where we&apos;ve gone one regular hikes, bike rides, and cooked and baked a ton. I won&apos;t pretend like everything has been perfect, but I&apos;m proud of our family and how active we are together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting on a serious note, I&apos;ve recognized something I&apos;ve been doing lately that I haven&apos;t been too proud of. It&apos;s a sign, I believe, that I carry a good deal of resentment about our heavy responsibilities. It has been driving me crazy to hear people complain about how hard it is to be at home with the kids or to adjust their lives to the pandemic. I have this compulsion to remind everyone how we had just a little bit of practice last year and how we have been able to take this in stride. While it&apos;s mostly true, I&apos;m probably only saying it to make myself feel better and (possibly) to make you be quiet. I really don&apos;t want to hear you complain about it. Yes, I have some sympathy for everyone because I know what it&apos;s like to have your life upended and control taken away. But, there&apos;s so much selfishness on display right now that it makes me angry. If you don&apos;t need to have your kids in daycare, if you don&apos;t need to go shopping right now, if you don&apos;t feel the need to wear a mask; sit your ass at home. Spend more time with your kids, read a book, learn to cook for yourself. You&apos;re screwing people that have to work, that are &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; into it by the lack of options our society gives them. You&apos;re screwing people that have medical conditions, vulnerabilities. Stop going to the gym you selfish bastards. Okay, it&apos;s out and I feel better. I don&apos;t know how I would behave if our circumstances were different, but I&apos;d probably take the opportunity to reflect on my life and choices. If you&apos;re complaining about more time at home with your family, maybe you&apos;ve made the wrong ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, however, feel fortunate and fulfilled in this moment. So many accidents and so much happenstance in the moments that have led to it have been counterbalanced by intention, love, and hard work. Natalie and I have seized opportunities and challenged ourselves for years to stay present and focused on our core values. I&apos;m probably going to head inside soon and have a mini mental breakdown trying to transition between work and family, but I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; doubt whether I want to be in there. There&apos;s never been a challenge more important than building a happy home and setting a positive example for our children. After all, home where one starts from. It shapes who you become and points you in the direction you&apos;re headed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aurelia, my love, has grown into quite the plucky and clever little child. Without her limitations, she would be on fire, dazzling. Her time will come, perhaps just a bit later than for the rest of us. With her limitations, she amazes and astounds her helpers with her intelligence and perseverance. When she finds her voice, she will be a person to be listened to and understood. I will put nothing past her. For that reason, we don&apos;t want to take any opportunity away from her either. A few weeks ago we resumed some in-person physical therapy, this time with therapists at Duke Children&apos;s Hospital. After a visit in June to their multidisciplinary CP clinic, we decided that we need to get Auri back to work. My hope is that having all her care and activities in the same system will give her a boost. With a new gait trainer at home, we brought Auri to a new physical therapist that communicated a lot of excitement and desire to work with her. Auri has graduated to a more complicated and difficult walker, more challenging foot/ankle orthotics, and continues to slowly demonstrate increased strength and ability. It&apos;s difficult, there are rarely breakthroughs. Rather, she sits upright a little longer, maybe takes some straighter steps, or &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; stronger (though I can&apos;t explain it). She&apos;s still moving forward physically (and getting chattier by the day).

&lt;p&gt;Max loves to cook. I&apos;ve been able to involve him more regularly, and he finds as much fulfillment in the work as I do. His commitment to completing a task wavers like it should at seven, but he&apos;s generally helpful and grateful to work with me. It&apos;s fun to watch both Max and Lennox learn from this process. They&apos;re clearly gathering the value of hard work and making things for yourself, but (more importantly) they&apos;re learning the value of others&apos; work. By making so much from scratch, we&apos;re teaching them to appreciate the value of anothers&apos; time and product. It doesn&apos;t hurt that we want for nothing in isolation.

&lt;p&gt;Lennox does not like to eat. Even though we have all of this amazing food to eat! We&apos;re churning out amazing pizzas, quiche, &lt;strong&gt;ratatoullie&lt;/strong&gt;, soups, bread, tacos, you name it! All homemade! He&apos;d rather have peanut butter crackers.  Fortunately, what Lennox lacks Natalie has in spades. I cook for her, mostly. And she&apos;s happy 😀. She&apos;s been rolling out the sourdough bread, and we&apos;re feeling heavy with joyful satisfaction.

&lt;p&gt;Our garden was a major feature of the summer. At the height of it all, we scooped up tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, green beans, blackberries, and raspberries with gusto. We harvested peaches, figs, and now pomegranates from our trees. Hopefully we&apos;ll get more than a single pear from our juvenile apple and pear next year, but we&apos;re reaping the fruits (literally) of previous years&apos; labor. Now that the garden has calmed down in the colder weather, I really miss it. I&apos;ve made a goal for myself to expand it this fall/winter, and I&apos;m shooting to build a little farm stand or join the Cary farmer&apos;s market in the Spring. I made a list of the food, relishes, snacks and so on that we can sell alongside some fresh produce. I think it will be fun and that our children will enjoy it.

&lt;p&gt;Things still need fixing, like three leaking toilets, a broken mower, a seized drill chuck, a dishwasher flood. Somehow I managed to also build a skateboard grind box for my neighbor, wire electricity in my shed, build some solid oak shelves and benches, and whatever other crazy stuff I came up with. We&apos;ve been &lt;em&gt;busy&lt;/em&gt; this summer, just how I like it.

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we&apos;ve resolved to become a camping family. We look at virtual school and remote work as an opportunity to become more mobile. There are quite a few steps to making this happen, but we want get a camper that we can travel with. For now, we&apos;ve taken to hiking the parks or woods regularly. I purchased a hiking pack to trek with Auri, and we&apos;re getting out more. We still have to step off trails all while walking, but we feel alright about it. After my dad came for a visit, we relaxed a bit and got out of the house more. We even order takeout once a week 😉.

&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s no place like home, which is great because we&apos;re back in ours and going to be spending a lot of time here. We&apos;ve made the decision to keep our isolation going for as long as it takes or as long as we&apos;re emotionally and mentally able. I wish there was some acceptable middle ground, but I&apos;m afraid that there&apos;s no way for us to calculate the risk of going out. Last year we almost lost a child, and, having spent many weeks without hope, I feel like it&apos;s our responsibility to protect what fortune granted. If schools re-open in the Fall, our boys will remain at home. We&apos;re picking up groceries once a month. And, we&apos;re holding all therapies over video. This adds additional burden to our already tired and stressed family, but I&apos;m confident that we&apos;re all willing and able to do this for each other. At the moment, I&apos;m actually writing from isolation in my house. I developed a cough, headache, and some symptoms after we were forced to let workers back in, despite having taken precautions. Thankfully, I started keeping my distance from Auri more than a few days ago when I noticed something felt off, but the persistent cough and low fever yesterday has pushed me over the edge and into in-home quarantine. This immediate situation feels outrageous, but it underscores how little it would take to bring down our house of cards. I recently read that people who have suffered trauma maintain anxiety to protect themselves from freaking out when something else goes wrong. That&apos;s my superpower! I had our fridge, freezer, and attic stocked before the first coronavirus case in North Carolina. We were primed for this last year and have had a lot of unique practice with stress. We&apos;ll be alright. We won&apos;t let this break us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we&apos;re back home, spending time outside, building things, and enjoying our space and nature again. We got caught with our pants down trying to quarantine at my mother&apos;s house. We didn&apos;t have the outdoor space that we all missed so much. Now we&apos;re spying on bunnies during breakfast (who ate up my garden by the way), and today I got to watch my neighbors try and catch an escaped chicken. Enjoying the fresh air, a couple of weeks ago we were &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/QFScADX7cFHF1bpV7&quot;&gt;working together to finish our garden.&lt;/a&gt; Simply said, we&apos;re relieved to be here; and, if I had to lock-in for a couple of years, this is where I would want to be. We still have junk everywhere and can&apos;t find time or energy to deal with it, but it&apos;s our junk! &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/MhF2FD7z9Hr1M5X29&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s the tour&lt;/a&gt;. I feel validated that we&apos;ve spent so much time learning how to be as self sufficient as possible. When our water heater blew a hose, I replaced it. When it started shorting because the crawlspace was flooded, I replaced a faulty circuit breaker and repaired the connections. We make our own bread, yogurt, pizza, pasta; and we cook a ton. We&apos;re already collecting black berries, growing fruits and vegetables, baking scones and pies, etc. We&apos;re well prepared for the coming year in that we have all the skills necessary to handle what might come up and to inject some fun and variety into our isolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody wants to know about Auri, of course. I don&apos;t have anything significant to share. I really wish that she were able to get to more independence, but she still has a long road to travel. With more time and perspective, we&apos;re able to understand how insanely difficult it is to stand up, walk, or crawl when your brain can&apos;t quickly get the signals to your extremities. Auri&apos;s already able to do a lot with assistance, and now we&apos;re trying to practice on finding her own balance and adjustments. I rigged our old kid&apos;s tower with a Jolly Jumper so she can practice side stepping and doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/TtFv2s42cG25fbJo8&quot;&gt;the Elmo slide&lt;/a&gt;. She&apos;s showing us that&apos;s she&apos;s able to compensate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/8SEyVFuApvjknj6z7&quot;&gt;make meaningful use of her hands and fingers&lt;/a&gt;. She has a lot of difficulty still, but there&apos;s function and progress nonetheless. While she &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y9HqHdsrmfxyw8dj8&quot;&gt;plays with Snow White&lt;/a&gt;, you can see that she keeps her right arm planted firmly on the table. She&apos;s supporting her trunk, and her difficulty with holding herself steady and raising arms makes it hard for her to perform bimanual tasks. It all comes back to her core. If she can get it, a lot of other things will start to fall in place. Unfortunately, it&apos;s a neurological issue and not simply a matter of strength. We keep working, waiting, and hoping that it will continue to improve and come together. But hope is not a strategy, so we&apos;ve stepped it up at home with physical therapy. We&apos;re doing a lot more &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/YRxoBNSi6A56cMoX7&quot;&gt;bench sitting and reaching&lt;/a&gt;, which, by the way, I don&apos;t think was really possible six months ago. We&apos;re also trying to make a habit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/g5mT4oE6tUZTf5sG7&quot;&gt;walking with a broom&lt;/a&gt;. The video is a month old, and she&apos;s getting a little better at it already. Auri has been walking with our hands well enough for a long time, but we hold her wrists and help her balance and weight shift. The broom really turns the difficulty up many fold. All of this is aimed at making it possible for her to independently use a walker or to transfer herself in and out of a wheelchair independently. And even when we&apos;re playing, we&apos;re tricking her into therapy, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vp54bYX79NfunoES9&quot;&gt;at-home hippotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. With the exception of the occasional day of parental burn out, we&apos;re keeping this up day in, day out. To give credit where it&apos;s due, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Natalie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; bears this burden almost entirely on her own and she does it with grace and strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, Natalie and I celebrated ten years of marriage by watching Coraline (it reminds us of our engagement). We reflected on the whirlwind decade, of those we lost and gained. We wanted adventure when we were young, and we certainly found it. Since my last update, all of us boys have &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/KsaScArfuSA1oDQj9&quot;&gt;celebrated birthdays&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would have preferred to celebrate these days with all of you, but perhaps there was something prescient in Natalie&apos;s big party. In January we got to see a number of friends that time and circumstance have distanced us from. I&apos;m happy that we had that opportunity because I&apos;m seriously doubting that we ever return to pre-2019 normal. We&apos;re truly living in the land of Oz now, and I feel less and less able to relate to my old self. By rough count, I estimate we&apos;ve taken our daughter to see the good witch at Duke Children&apos;s Hospital over thirty times in the last year and a half, with Auri screaming each visit at having vials and vials of blood stolen from her. Yet, our journey leads onward; and we expect more tests of our intelligence, compassion, and courage. But, we&apos;ve learned that the Emerald City is a fantasy; there&apos;s no wizard nor magic to take us away. We&apos;re already home. We follow the yellow brick road now to learn more about ourselves and how to better love each other. It will be just the five of us on this journey for awhile, and there&apos;s really no place like home because home is wherever we&apos;re together.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Unpleasant Situation]]></title><description><![CDATA["It’s important to recognize that pandemics are difficult to talk about.

&lt;p&gt;&quot;It’s important to recognize that pandemics are difficult to talk about. Anything said in advance of a pandemic seems alarmist. After a pandemic begins, anything one has said or done is inadequate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year, I had hoped that my family could focus on health and recovery in 2020. Now, we &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; find ourselves in an unprecedented pandemic requiring unprecedented action. As I speak with friends and family, I often hear, &quot;we&apos;re being careful.&quot; Unfortunately, we know from experiences in other parts of the world that being careful will not be enough. This extremely contagious virus spreads at exponential speed which means that when we&apos;re finally feeling the pressure, it will be too late. The USA is woefully behind on testing, so we are likely in the midst of a much wider and faster outbreak than the number of reported cases suggest. Still, we are seeing the same explosive growth of positive cases and rate of infections as other places in the world. We&apos;re simply a week behind Europe, and I expect we&apos;re all in for a tremendous shock in one or two weeks. I&apos;m asking all of you that read this to heed the warnings and self-isolate now. You should not go anywhere unless it&apos;s critical and you should expect this behavior to be necessary for weeks. You may have heard the reality that we&apos;re past the possibility of containment, that everyone will eventually become infected. Our efforts now are aimed at &quot;flattening the curve,&quot; slowing the infection rate so we don&apos;t overload our hospitals. &quot;It&apos;s the difference between finding an ICU bed &amp;#x26; ventilator or being treated in the parking lot tent.&quot; For medically complex children like Aurelia, this will be a life or death distinction. Please take this seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Natalie and Auri @ KKI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been asked a few times to give an update about how Auri and Natalie are doing in Baltimore. In my last blog post I had mentioned the possibility of Auri participating in intensive rehabilitation programs and I managed to make a lot happen very quickly since then. I was able to get my employer to cover Auri&apos;s full therapy schedule for the year; we would have exceeded our insurance plan limits. This gave us the freedom to maintain an aggressive schedule, and I researched and found a number of outpatient therapy programs that would be covered by insurance. The first of three programs this year started at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore on March 2nd. Despite my serious reservations about it, Natalie and I have decided to keep Auri in the program until Friday. They&apos;ve been in Baltimore for two weeks now, and Natalie feels like the experience has been important for Auri. We&apos;re uncertain whether we&apos;ll be able to maintain appointments with therapists when she returns and doubtful that we&apos;ll be able to participate in upcoming programs in June and October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, they&apos;re staying isolated at the Ronald McDonald House, which has cancelled activities and volunteers and restricted visitors. At Kennedy Krieger they&apos;re doing the same, and I hope that it&apos;s enough. Natalie has shared that Auri has made small but obvious improvements in occupational and speech therapy. They&apos;ve been using kinesiology tape to keep her fingers open and they&apos;ve introduced an assistive communication device to encourage and motivate Auri to communicate. From Natalie&apos;s perspective, the entire experience has been incredibly stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Auri&apos;s MRI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offered a small mention of this on the Facebook, but the results of Auri&apos;s recent brain MRI are encouraging. She has not suffered any signs of additional damage since last year. I spoke with Auri&apos;s doctor on Friday, and she shared a less formal interpretation than the one on Auri&apos;s medical records. Auri&apos;s MRI spectroscopy results, which indicate the presence and levels of certain substances in the brain, found elevations of substances known to be a part of cellular membranes. Elevations in these values can be seen when there&apos;s active inflammation destroying cells, but there&apos;s an alternative, less studied possibility that cells are being created and healing is occurring. In the opinion of the experienced radiologist that was consulted, this is a sign of the latter, that the results are &quot;consistent with a healing brain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the actual MRI process, it was nerve wracking. We had to reschedule this thing multiple times because of colds and our previously mentioned screw up. Natalie had been fighting a lot of anxiety about it because there have been a lot of reports from parents about major disease flares after anesthesia. I may have been naive in thinking that the complications were due to children being at a high risk for aspiration pneumonia. I&apos;ve heard a few strange things since, and Auri&apos;s MRI was &quot;weird&quot; according to the sedation doctor. She woke up in the middle of the MRI on what should have been a sufficient dose of sedatives to keep her asleep, and, throughout, her breathing was &quot;irregular.&quot; Afraid to give her more of the same thing and risk respiratory depression, they used a fast acting but shorter lasting drug to get her back to sleep so they could finish the imaging. It was emotionally exhausting, and I&apos;m glad it&apos;s over. The night before, I believe I told a parent that it would be &quot;worth it&quot; if it led to additional therapy and research for the community. Now, I feel less confident about doing it again; and the coronavirus is going to put a halt to elective procedures for the forseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first discovered that Auri was experiencing brain injury, we were told that it was likely the result of a &quot;leukodystrophy.&quot; These diseases are simply horrifying. When we eventually received a genetic diagnosis and learned more about AGS, there was a really slim, narrow ray of hope in that this disease may not be entirely progressive or degenerative. For most children with AGS, this just isn&apos;t so or the disease is simply discovered too late for any of these considerations to make enough of a difference. But, a small minority suffer a milder disability, often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy. Only very recently, and in only a handful of children that I know of, there have been kids like my daughter, with a severe attack that have had access to this new drug and treatment. I&apos;ve mentioned them before. They&apos;re all still very young, but some of them are speaking, one&apos;s crawling, another is doing both, and they&apos;ve been developing generally well. Auri may be a touch more affected then the children I&apos;m thinking of, but she and they are remarkably fortunate for this treatment that appears to be working in their uncertain category of severity. It&apos;s obvious that they have been mostly stable, but I have this sense that they were artificially moved into the non-progressive category. They&apos;ve only joined the ranks of AGS children that can walk or talk because they had quick access to treatment. We really don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on in their heads or what to make of their potential yet. So, it&apos;s really encouraging to get MRI results that suggest the likelihood of repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More for Another Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s more to share, like how our friend Patrick visited Natalie and Auri one weekend, how my mother in law came from Florida and drove my boys back and forth from school, how I&apos;m going to be alone with them at home this week now that our school system has closed, or how we won&apos;t be back in our home for many weeks. If I had been told a few years ago what the pressure would feel like right now, I would have laughed. I suppose humans are incredibly resilient because I&apos;m still grateful for what we have and where we are. Yet, I hope that everyone takes this new threat seriously and that the additional pressure placed on those of us with complex lives doesn&apos;t press to hard. Be safe; hole up; have a nice cold pint; and wait for this all to blow over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have heard that there was a clinical trial at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) using the drug baricitinib or (especially if you&apos;re outside of the USA) you may have heard about a related drug ruxolitinib. You might have heard that they can put your child&apos;s immune system at risk or you might have heard that they haven&apos;t been proven to work. If you&apos;ve been talking to parents of children using these drugs, you&apos;ve probably heard positive things by now and I would like to help explain what I can. I&apos;ll be mostly writing about baricitinib because there&apos;s more information, but I would argue that ruxolitinib confers similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we the parents have found these drugs to be very helpful. My key takeaways from what I&apos;ve learned and experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been relatively safe (in the few years that kids have been taking it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has been beneficial (especially for those with less severe AGS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a very few cases, my daughter&apos;s included, baricitinib has appeared to halt active, ongoing, and severe brain damage caused by a later onset of AGS. But whether your child has mild, moderate, or severe disease, all parents that I&apos;ve spoken to have found their children to be happier and more comfortable while taking one of these drugs. In many cases, our children have demonstrated continued development, which is a strong sign that these drugs are protecting them from further injury. It seems likely that the benefits would be felt greatest by those with less severe disease and that gain access to it as early as possible. But, it&apos;s unclear to me whether it can significantly change outcomes for children that present in the first few months after birth. It may not change the neurological outcome of most children with AGS, both because we can&apos;t get to it soon enough and their disease may be too severe; but it appears to improve their quality of life, perhaps by reducing systemic inflammation. Regardless, baricitinib seems like the right thing to do. It may well be the only thing to do, but it has been both safe and promising for the somewhere around 40 children with AGS that it has been given to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Clinical Trials&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baricitinib&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With baricitinib, the current phase 2 clinical trial in the USA runs out of CHOP (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554&quot;&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554&lt;/a&gt;) and comes on the heels of a successful phase 1 trial (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580&quot;&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phase 1 - A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug&apos;s most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phase 2 - A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug&apos;s effectiveness).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to note that researchers at CHOP decided that giving placebo to participants of the second phase trial would be inhumane because of the benefits that they observed in patients during the first phase. Still, they emphasized in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.research.chop.edu/cornerstone-blog/multi-site-study-builds-better-clinical-trials-for-aicardi-goutieres-syndrome&quot;&gt;their PR materials&lt;/a&gt; that their phase 1 trial would not focus on assessing efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vanderver emphasizes that the current project is not about testing whether or not baricitinib works. Instead, it focuses on the creation of appropriate assessments and biomarkers for testing the effectiveness of all proposed treatments for AGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of baricitinib in AGS spawned out of work by Dr. Goldbach-Mansky at the NIH (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649002&quot;&gt;JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib in the treatment of autoinflammatory interferonopathies.&lt;/a&gt;). It was, in fact, the same clinical trial. They transferred the study from the NIH to CHOP and began enrolling more children with AGS. The NIH did the original ground work of figuring out how to dose the drug and measure its effect on disease biomarkers (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134648&quot;&gt;Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Proposed Dosing of the Oral JAK1 and JAK2 Inhibitor Baricitinib in Pediatric and Young Adult CANDLE and SAVI Patients.&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, we lost one child with AGS during the clinical trial; but the teams decided that it wasn&apos;t directly the cause of the drug and could be explained by complications from their disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ruxolitinib&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress. Dr. Crow&apos;s work with ruxolitinib involved individual case studies. His group has been reluctant to claim any success, but the results appear similar to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Safety&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of safety, we&apos;re waiting for CHOP to directly publish their findings. However, we&apos;re able to draw conclusions from presentations and abstracts they&apos;ve submitted at conferences (including our AGS family conference in 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.childneurologysociety.org/meetings/2019-cns-annual-meeting/&quot;&gt;Child Neurology Society&apos;s 2019 annual meeting&lt;/a&gt; in October of 2019, the team at CHOP submitted some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.childneurologysociety.org/docs/default-source/2019-CNS/2019-cns-program.pdf&quot;&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt; addressing their clinical trials in AGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Label use of the Janus Kinase Inhibitor Baricitinib in a Genetic Interferonopathy, Aicardi Goutières Syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Vanderver A (Philadelphia, PA), Adang L, Gavazzi F, Ulrick N, Koh J, McDonald K, Peer K, Besnier C, Cross Z, Helman G, Rhee J, Takanohashi A, Armangue T, GoldbackMansky R, Shults J&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;: All serious adverse events were secondary to the underlying disease. There were variable laboratory abnormalites at baseline and on study. Baricitinib decreased IFN-stimulated gene expression and improved symptoms (e.g irritability, skin inflammation) as recorded by the daily AGS symptom diary. While traditional outcome measures were inconsistent over time, our exploratory AGS scale demonstrated improvement in neurologic function in a significant subset of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions&lt;/em&gt;: Barictinib was safely administered to AGS individuals. We found floor effects in traditional outcome measures, but our AGS scale demonstrated promise. This study establishes the foundation for safety and possible efficacy of JAK-inhibitors in children with genetic interferonopathies such as AGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most important point is that &lt;em&gt;they&apos;ve concluded that baricitinib is safe&lt;/em&gt;. Any problems experienced by their patients could be explained by their AGS and preexisting condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How Does it Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress. Baricitinib and Ruxolitinib don&apos;t treat the primary causes of AGS. Instead, the act as strong anti-inflammatory drugs that hopefully keep the brain and other tissues from damaging themselves. They&apos;re considered inefficient therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Efficacy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress. Efficacy has been difficult to establish because in most cases there has been too much brain damage already accrued to expect these drug therapies to change much. However, we have a few compelling anecdotes here. Again, it appears that children with less severe brain injury, particularly those with later onset symptoms, are able to treat their disease and recover some. There appears to be a very short window of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made a mistake yesterday, a small one that won&apos;t have any real consequences; but it has me thinking about the pressure we&apos;ve put ourselves under over the last 12 months. We&apos;re still eagerly anticipating a stem cell therapy for Auri this year, and, in order to measure its effects, Auri will need baseline and post-treatment MRIs of her brain. We expect FDA approval soon. Unfortunately, we had to reschedule the baseline MRI in December due to the illness I previously wrote about and yesterday because we let Auri drink an ounce of apple juice 30 minutes after the cutoff time. So, to the mistake and consequences. The mistake seems so minor an innocent. We focused on the need to stop eating many hours beforehand, but failed to internalize the stop time for fluids. The consequence may be a delay in this therapy that we have hopes for. The odds seem high that she&apos;ll be sick again in two weeks when we retry and that we&apos;ll have to reschedule and delay again. We have no idea if any of this will be of consequence, but we&apos;re both really angry at ourselves for the mistake. In this and in other ways, Natalie and I place ourselves under an extreme amount of pressure to help Auri recover. And, in this and in other ways, we have little to no understanding of how consequential our efforts will be. The pressure has resulted in, for me at least, an emotional bankruptcy that requires a restructuring. Out of necessity, I&apos;m forced to start adjusting how I think about Auri and her future. The bottom line is that Auri has been remarkably stable and consistent. She&apos;s developing; not as quickly as we had hoped, but straightforwardly like a child with cerebral palsy. This year will have to be different for us, in that we need to stop sprinting and start training for the marathon. We&apos;re raising a child with disabilities, and we&apos;ll need to develop more endurance to maintain a happy and healthy family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks have been a little tricky but everything has been mostly good since my last big update in October. Since then, Auri started rolling and army crawling (if we force her to). In November, she started showing more strength and ability in her gait trainer. Through all of this, she&apos;s communicating more verbally. She still has significantly delayed and impaired speech, but she&apos;s been using new words and putting new sounds together. She has graced us with new words including, but not limited to, &quot;Elmo,&quot; &quot;let it go,&quot; &quot;walk,&quot; &quot;door,&quot; &quot;floor,&quot; &quot;knock knock,&quot; &quot;Olaf,&quot; &quot;uh huh&quot; (for yes). She works hard at finding ways to ask for what she wants, and I&apos;m happy to see her getting better at it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we wrapped up the year in a bit of distress. On Christmas, Natalie and I sent our boys with my mom because we couldn&apos;t join for dinner. Auri had a terrible cough that came on just after getting past an unrelated, febrile illness that scared us into the hospital. It had really upsetting echoes of how this all began last year and came literally on the same dates. I was a real party pooper on New Year&apos;s Eve, but I was just too drained to enjoy myself. The next day we moved to our temporary home (I&apos;ll explain later) after struggling to pack up our house in time, and by the end of the week I found another large tumor on our dog Misha. It was removed, thankfully benign; but it set the tone for the year. A few days later I threw a surprise birthday party for Natalie, found that Auri&apos;s front teeth are loosening; and the carousel ride continued. We&apos;re also fighting insurance limits and denials for the large number of physical and occupational therapy appointments we maintain, floating a lot of bills until we know what to do. I have a lot more to say about that now that we&apos;re big spenders in the health care system, but I&apos;ll keep it short. To hell with it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recap of the Last 12 Months&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been about 12 months now, since our lives changed. The really acute, terrifying events of last year occurred between December 2018 and February 2019. That period was traumatizing, and it has had lasting and serious effects on our emotional well being (something I constantly reflect on). The heavy stuff went as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 2018, we thought Auri might have an orthopedic problem with her ankle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 2018, Auri never really recovered from an extended illness at Christmas time. We began to worry. She was tired and slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 3rd, 2018, on her birthday, Natalie took Auri to the pediatrician who decided to call Duke Neurology. They suggested we bring her to the emergency room rather than wait for an out-patient consultation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 7th-8th 2019, Auri had extensive workup at the hospital, including an MRI that suggested a leukodystrophy. The vast majority of these diseases are terminal, and it was my understanding that it would probably take her life within the year. And, to make matters worse, the inheritance of these diseases put the odds of Max or Lennox having the same close to 50%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 23rd 2019, the last day that Auri crawled on her own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January 24th 2019, we received a diagnosis from genetic testing and talked with Auri&apos;s neurologist about the lack of treatment options. There was some suggestion in the literature that a particular drug could be helpful, but it wasn&apos;t well documented and there wasn&apos;t an open clinical trial to join. The literature also gave the impression that, with luck, Auri&apos;s regression might stop without taking her life early, although she would be &quot;devastatingly&quot; disabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 7th 2019, we were told that the drug wasn&apos;t an option and that we would have to simply hope for the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 8th 2019, I freaked the fuck out after a scary week and a particularly bad night of Auri not sleeping, crying all the time, and choking while eating and drinking. I contacted everyone I could and starting making demands. I labored over my words and writing, knowing that I would get one shot at making it happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February 14th 2019, day one of her drug therapy 😀.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 2019 2019, we travelled to Philadelphia where they&apos;ve been doing clinical trials. We couldn&apos;t do more than guess based on their experiences, but I left with the impression that this therapy could work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, after all that, it&apos;s just been a series of over reactions and panic. We&apos;ve been terrified by every cold, cough, and fever. We&apos;ve scrutinized every movement, changes in Auri&apos;s strength, and all the little details inherent in her treatment and trajectory. After starting the drug, Auri began babbling again almost immediately, she began sleeping better, and she more than made up for the weight she had lost. Where in February she had zero strength when carried, after the drug she began to hold herself upright. We observed a significant, immediate rebound in the first weeks followed by a slower development more natural for someone with disabilities. I&apos;ve often answered questions about how Auri&apos;s doing with, &quot;she&apos;s doing much better than we are.&quot; Everyone has been quick to remind me that she seems bigger, stronger, and more mature with every week and month. You&apos;ve all been right. We (or maybe just I) have been living most of the year with our heads and hearts stuck in the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Present and the Coming Year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri has grown and matured considerably since last March. She&apos;s no longer a baby and very clear about what she wants. She loves to listen to music, especially songs from the Frozen movies. She has Elmo, Olaf, Anna, and Elsa dolls that have to go everywhere with her. She&apos;s &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; asking to walk and loves to explore every room and corner. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/UHfYJynDqenABfFSA&quot;&gt;She loves to dip her french fries in ketchup&lt;/a&gt;. She&apos;s a funny little girl, and we&apos;re able to do just about everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Play and Exercise Are One and the Same&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing looks a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/njMPgxqnsfmb1nFE6&quot;&gt;rolling around, singing songs&lt;/a&gt;, and constant &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/DEBycDe71ZN5U3KH9&quot;&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. At Christmas, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnwFMATLRUEf92ux7&quot;&gt;Auri practiced hard in her gait trainer&lt;/a&gt;, although we can be inconsistent about having her do it. She asks to walk constantly, which requires us to hold her hands for support (I&apos;m hoping to get her somewhat independent in her gait trainer soon, because our backs are killing us). She&apos;s come a long way since the summer. I remember telling a physical therapist then how proud I was that Auri walked (with my support) &quot;at least 20 steps around the playground.&quot; At the time, we were still holding most of her weight with our hands under her armpits. Now we hold her hands or wrists. She still needs a lot of support and correction, but she&apos;s holding herself and carrying all of her weight in her legs. We can walk around the house or playground for an hour, easily over 100 steps though I&apos;ve never counted by how much. In the past month, we all (including the professionals) have noticed smoother stepping. At times, Auri&apos;s sort of holding it all together a little better, leaning on us less and taking more natural steps. She has a long way to go, but she still seems determined to get there. The existential challenge is whether her development and improving strength can keep up with her growth. Length and weight place further demands on a child that has difficulty with motor planning and muscle isolation. Auri will need a wheelchair in the future, and all of this play and exercise might be the difference between a powered or manual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many days we&apos;d love to just plop her in a chair in front of the television, but who are we to deprive her? She&apos;s a two year old that wants to explore, and we feel like it&apos;s our responsibility to say yes as much as possible. She&apos;s dependent on us, and we&apos;re determined to give her every opportunity. The therapists all say, &quot;life is the best therapy;&quot; and a physiatrist recently told me that being on her feet is better than stretching at helping Auri avoid muscle and joint problems associated with disability. More than once I&apos;ve been given the soft advice to take it easy or give ourselves a break. We simply can&apos;t. Everyone probably feels like they&apos;d do anything for their children, but we&apos;ve been called to task. Natalie and I try to tag in and out as best as possible, but we still burn out. Thank you to everyone that assists with other things in our lives because it helps us maintain enough energy to keep this up. I&apos;m just not yet ready to adjust or give up on reaching for better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Home Remodel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we&apos;re living at my mother&apos;s house while our house gets destroyed. For years we&apos;ve delayed home renovations due to unexpected events and expenses. It feels a little like it doesn&apos;t matter anymore. The future isn&apos;t going to look anything like I thought it would, so we&apos;re going to try and focus as much as possible on the present. We couldn&apos;t really afford to build Auri an accessible addition, so we&apos;re doing what we can to open the space up for her whether she&apos;s in a walker or a wheel chair. Years from now we may have to revisit all this if it&apos;s too difficult and we&apos;re carrying her up and down the stairs, but we&apos;re going to buy some time with some added conveniences. We expect to be back in our home before thes spring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Health and Well Being&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our family has greatly improved in this regard. Max and Lennox seem to be a bit happier, and Natalie and I have been more present and patient. Max and Lennox have demonstrated small but significant adjustments, like playing with Auri and generally being more helpful. I think they&apos;re happier because Natalie and I have been more engaged. There&apos;s a positive feedback loop, too. The more fun we have together, the more patient we all are with each other. That patience is what has made the difference. Thank goodness because everyone here was in a lot of pain last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for Natalie and I, we&apos;re a bit up and down and in and out. I find myself benefiting a great deal from regular appointments with a counselor. It might sound a little silly, but it&apos;s a big deal to me and the family that I was able to start cooking again. We still fall behind on a lot of chores, but less and less its because of outright depression. Although we&apos;re both oscillating, we rarely find ourselves struggling at the same time. More likely, one of us picks up the slack for the other. The self-pity has been fading away, and the fatigue (emotional and physical) has been easier to overcome. Still, we&apos;re overdue for a date night.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think that Natalie would be forthcoming about this with many, but it&apos;s all true. I don&apos;t feel particularly vulnerable about sharing. Rather, I hope that my honesty brings us (and others) some understanding or empathy. This trauma that we&apos;ve experienced and the difficulty that lies ahead is very isolating. We&apos;re wounded, in a way, and asking for help sometimes feels like debasing ourselves further. I don&apos;t really want to ask anybody for anything, and I&apos;m really grateful when I don&apos;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Window of Opportunity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of April, Natalie will be taking Auri to an intensive, 3-week, many hour a day physical therapy center in Boston. On the advice of our new physiatrist, I&apos;m going to pursue insurance approval for a similar inpatient rehabilitation program given that it appears Auri has suffered a one time neurological injury. Maybe we can pack two of these into this year. I have a sense that the window of opportunity has been closing, and, while it will never close entirely, the speed at which Auri develops and the ultimate limits she&apos;ll encounter will be largely defined within the first two years of her recovery. For this reason, I&apos;ve continued to be a bit obsessive about learning and understanding everything I can. It&apos;s impossible for me to know whether any of it will make a difference, but now is the time that it will count the most. It&apos;s great, then, that we have plans this year and a doctor working on something unprecedented. While I don&apos;t believe we can accelerate Auri&apos;s development much, I hope that we can keep it from slowing down for as long as possible. For now, we have to emphasize her trunk strength and posture. Everything that comes next depends on her ability to stabilize herself, and, in my assessment, she&apos;s been toeing the line. We&apos;ll continue to do everything we can to help her cross it and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Lies Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is very difficult to predict, I have much more knowledge than I had for most of the last year. It&apos;s clear that Auri will be challenged by disability. Less clear is whether her disease will present new or serious issues. I believe that we&apos;ll be using cerebral palsy as a model for her development and care, focusing on her disabilities and function more than her disease. I can compare Auri to the development curves for children with CP, and, while I don&apos;t like what I see, it&apos;s not unreasonable to think she could outperform them. Auri had a developmental head start, and her injury is still fresh; she may be given more time to keep going. Regardless, I expect her to be in need of a wheel chair and special education. The degree to which she&apos;ll be able to communicate or manage independence is what remains unclear. She&apos;s smart, though; and I expect her to make the most of it in whatever challenges she&apos;s facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all still a very good and a successful outcome. In the most profound sense, my pleas in January were granted; and I recognize how fortunate Auri is now. That sentiment will feel like a load of bullshit to her when she gets older, but she won&apos;t have held a sick and prostrate infant in her arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri&apos;s now favorite song is the best way I can think to describe my changing perspective on what has passed and what lies ahead. Listen to it on repeat, because it makes me laugh a little harder every time I hear it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJV4vjlziNI&quot;&gt;One day, when I&apos;m old and wise, I&apos;ll think back and realize that these were all completely normal events!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Merry Christmas]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's been awhile, and I wanted to write to tell you all that we're still moving forward.

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been awhile, and I wanted to write to tell you all that we&apos;re still moving forward. And, with the exception of the past week or two, things have been going well. We&apos;re sick right now, Auri with the worst of it, in a way almost identical to the illness that sparked her catastrophe last Christmas. For most of this year, a night like tonight would have been unbearable; but in the many months that have passed, we&apos;ve been permitted more confidence and have cultivated some fortitude. Many of the children in situations similar to Auri&apos;s have stayed healthy, happy, and developing. Many, including Auri, struggle with significant disability; but they&apos;ve demonstrated the ability to improve, slowly, such as one with a brain injury might. There will be limitations to Auri&apos;s recovery, but recovery itself would have been impossible if her disease had began even a year or two earlier. So tonight I&apos;m holding my breath, hoping that this illness passes without consequence like the others of 2019. And, I&apos;m hoping for advancements in the coming years. I plan to write a larger update at the start of the new year, but I&apos;ll share that we&apos;ve experienced a breakthrough in the past month or two. Auri has been able to roll to toys and can army crawl short distances. She does this with a lot of difficulty, but she can be persistent. In 2020, I think we&apos;ll find out just how much of a difference that can make. Merry Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happy Birthday, Aurelia]]></title><description><![CDATA[We're excitedly celebrating Aurelia's second birthday today, and we trust that the years to come will be kinder than what has passed.

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re excitedly celebrating Aurelia&apos;s second birthday today, and we trust that the years to come will be kinder than what has passed. We turn the page on &lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt;, but we find an empty book and an uncertain future. Her unwritten story will be unique and full of joy and accomplishments, and I can&apos;t wait to read it. Auri&apos;s already &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rd4A629fRqjSeHkc8&quot;&gt;rolling over&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/feHNKGQZMejpmvTLA&quot;&gt;making silly faces&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/eZmPhG5ihmuGwTgk8&quot;&gt;feeding herself&lt;/a&gt;. She&apos;s the kind of child that proudly writes her own narrative and defies her limitations. We&apos;re thrilled for this terrific two!&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;ll admit that I had hoped for more improvement this year and that Auri&apos;s steady progress has been slower than I had anticipated. And when it comes to my goal of writing to help others, I realize this had turned into a tool for my own catharsis that hasn&apos;t really been working. Natalie&apos;s voice has been mostly absent, and I feel like mine has been mostly repetitive. I don&apos;t feel like there&apos;s much more to say other than how unfair this wild ride has been for my family and daughter. Although I keep reminding myself (and anybody who will listen) how fortunate Auri really is, I&apos;m left with the sad reality that her and our struggles will continue indefinitely. I don&apos;t want to keep repeating the ambiguity of it all so I plan to stretch out these posts moving forward. I&apos;ll write sooner if there&apos;s anything significant to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another month and another unexpected hospitalization. Thank god it wasn&apos;t Auri, but I&apos;m feeling worn thin by all of the health care navigation this year. My father was sick enough to spend over a week in a hospital bed, and I made the decision to head to New York and help him after a discouraging phone call with his infectious disease specialist. I believe it was the fourth hospital I&apos;d been to in a month, so I&apos;m wracking up experience points at getting attention and answers. I don&apos;t know what the hell I&apos;m doing, but fortunately neither does anybody else. The game seems to be about recognizing when you&apos;re getting ignored and understanding just enough to trigger a more thoughtful dialogue. You can&apos;t really do anything about the shitty system, but you can command a little more attention than you&apos;d be getting otherwise. It sucks, but you can make it a little better for yourself or others by not taking anything for granted. Especially at a hospital, the doctors and nurses are busy, tired, and over-extended. Don&apos;t take it for granted that they&apos;re giving you the best care. They know what they&apos;re saying, but they&apos;re tired and work in a high stress environment. A few days ago I came across some notes that worked their way out of some drawer or junk pile of mine. In January, when we had no idea what was going on, I spent sleepless nights researching the long list of spinal fluid tests that were pending for Auri. I was trying to understand what each of them were for, what diseases they might detect, and what the prognosis might be. Of course I didn&apos;t solve any mysteries, and I was horrified writing things like &quot;prognosis poor&quot;, &quot;few years,&quot; &quot;progressive.&quot; But, I also wrote things like &quot;HSCT curative if performed early.&quot; Would you care to guess how or why I got Auri to doctor Kurtzberg so early? Nobody will advocate for you better than yourself. Stay on top of things. It might be important and make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into family updates, I feel like it&apos;s important to share that Natalie had written a blog post while I was away. After talking together about its tone, we decided to not publish it. However, I would be remiss if I didn&apos;t explore her thoughts and give them some attention. I don&apos;t want her to feel silenced; anybody in her position might feel the same way. She has been in a lot of pain; we both have, on and off throughout the year. Sometimes that pain has been directed outward, toward and against friends or family members, in part because we have nowhere else to direct it. We feel disappointment, some shame, and gratitude for our relationships and interactions. But, when we&apos;re feeling anxious, which I&apos;m certain will continue intermittently for a long time, we feel angry. I&apos;m sure that you&apos;ve attended a funeral. Do you remember the awkwardness of it all? What are you supposed to say? &quot;I&apos;m sorry for your loss,&quot; seems to be the standard. But what does it really mean? It means you don&apos;t know what to say and you don&apos;t know what the other party wants to hear. From my perspective, the distraught probably doesn&apos;t even know what they want to hear and it likely changes with their mood. Well, we were the distraught, only recently downgraded to &lt;em&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/em&gt;. And in all this time, I&apos;ve wanted lots of sympathy, more than I&apos;ve received. When I&apos;m at the playground, I actually hope people will ask me about Auri so I can tell them about what&apos;s happened. They never do, and then I feel kind of ashamed for wishing it in the first place. The emotions are complicated. I know that Natalie feels complicated; she&apos;s always been complicated. So, have you acknowledged how hard she&apos;s working? How much acknowledgement is enough? How much is too much? There&apos;s this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; fine, fuzzy line between celebrating her strength and being sorrowful. And what about Auri? How should you treat her? She&apos;s smart and painfully aware of her limitations. Don&apos;t talk to her like she&apos;s mentally challenged, but don&apos;t overdo it either. Maybe it&apos;s just too complicated and it&apos;s easier to keep your distance. But, we&apos;ve noticed that too. One of my first thoughts in January, noticing how quiet it got around us, was &quot;do people think we deserve this?&quot; There just probably isn&apos;t a right way to handle any of this. As much as we&apos;d like to, we&apos;re not going to be getting off this wild ride anytime soon. It&apos;s making us a little crazy, so my recommendation would be to try and act normal. Normal is all we&apos;ve been begging for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sharing a lot of videos this month. This is our historical record. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t too much significantly different from last month, but I continue to believe we&apos;re watching Auri grow up and catch up. Unfortunately, we received somewhat disappointing news from the dentist. But, just as in many other aspects of all of this, it could have been much worse. Auri&apos;s teeth have been coming in correctly and without any obvious problems. But, an X-Ray showed that the roots of her baby teeth are underdeveloped. She&apos;ll probably lose them early, maybe a couple years sooner than average. We won&apos;t know for years if this will happen to her permanent teeth, but many children with Auri&apos;s genotype suffer chronic and serious dental issues. Considering the spectrum of disease severity, this again seems to place Auri in an affected, but relatively lucky category. With any luck, her treatment will protect her developing permanent teeth from insult and her heart and bones from calcium related conditions. We also have to reauthorize the use of her medication with our insurance company. They originally approved it for six months. As I write, we&apos;ve already submitted the appropriate paperwork and provided clinical notes supporting its benefit. I&apos;m going to guess that it will get approved for another year, but we&apos;ll have to keep doing this ad infinitum. Finally, the proposal for her cellular therapy has been submitted to the FDA. She would be the first with her disease to receive this, and I maintain hope that it we&apos;ll see considerable benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like I always write these updates after a good, strong week or two that&apos;s inevitably followed by a slow and concerning couple of weeks. Auri seems to have this cadence, two strong weeks, three slow ones. It might be that she (or all of us) develop a mild cold. It may be that she&apos;s not sleeping well; she&apos;s erupting a bunch of teeth at the same time. I&apos;m told by her neurologist that it&apos;s fairly normal for people with brain injuries to experience transient fatigue like this. The term is recrudescence. Still, it&apos;s hard to watch and takes Natalie and I to the edge of sanity each time. A week after I post a video of her standing and walking with only one arm for support, Auri will be tired and floppy. She was worn out at the start of this month. Last week we were back on track; I felt great. This week I feel myself tensing up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I want to commend Natalie for the grueling, frustrating, but necessary work she puts in every day. Natalie gets discouraged with the lack of progress, but she has managed to mostly keep the mindset that this is about putting in the work. For example, she gets Auri in this walker almost every day (video below) and makes her take at least a few steps on her own despite the yelling and protests. Natalie pushes Auri to try, especially in situations that Auri finds difficult, always encouraging her to reach higher. You have to put in the work and &quot;keep plugging away.&quot; This is about endurance and persistence. The gains, if any, won&apos;t be realized for years; but Natalie keeps the faith and Auri working. We&apos;ve started to look for intensive therapy programs in a couple of places around the country, too. You typically spend three weeks at a specialized center, with daily, intensive therapies aimed at specific, attainable goals. We already have a lot going on, but we&apos;ll swing it somehow, preferably during her cellular therapy to maximize benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just take a look at our schedule: physical therapy at least three times a week, speech therapy twice a week, occupational therapy once a week, and doctors, dentists, etc. We recently saw a physiatrist that commended us. &quot;You&apos;re doing everything right.&quot; Thank goodness, because it never feels like enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a little bit of a weight scare recently. Auri didn&apos;t gain any weight between her August and September appointments. We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s significant, but the last time this happened things were spiraling out of control. She&apos;s getting like 6 teeth at once, though, and she might have been a little sick. She&apos;s also getting bigger and it&apos;s taking a little longer to feed her. Of concern, she seems to have less of an appetite and gag on food towards the end of a meal. Still, she&apos;s able to do a little bit of this on her own now. We can&apos;t expect her to eat a plate of food by herself, but she&apos;s alright to sit by herself with some snacks. This month, Auri&apos;s weight gain seems to be back on track; but we&apos;re in a holding pattern to see if these feeding issues are new or dangerous developments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Auri struggles to sit up straight or move things around in her hands; but I think she&apos;s developing a bit more coordination. You can see her sitting forward without shoulder straps or a tray and watch her trying to spin and rotate Natalie&apos;s phone with her hands in bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auri has also been trying to tell jokes and be surprisingly silly recently. It&apos;s an obvious sign to us that she&apos;s all there mentally. She might need a little development and maturation of her humor, but here&apos;s a sense of what she&apos;s been doing. Sitting on the porch with Natalie during the day, Auri was asked &quot;where&apos;s Lennox?&quot; Natalie was trying to get her to practice new sign language, &quot;school&quot; and &quot;work&quot;; and Auri answered (with her hands), &quot;work.&quot; &quot;Do you mean school?&quot; Natalie asked. Auri shook her head no, &quot;work. work. work. work.&quot; &quot;Lennox is at work?&quot; Natalie questioned, and Auri broke into a huge giggle. &quot;Noooooo;&quot; she was just being silly and getting a kick out of herself. This morning, while I was feeding her breakfast, I was engaging this dancing, spooky halloween tree toy my mom gave us. Auri liked the song it sang but I turned it around because she was a little nervous about the moving face. We kept playing the song while she ate, and at one point I asked her if she wanted me to play it again. &quot;No. No. No.&quot; she kept shaking her head and muttering. &quot;You don&apos;t want me to play it?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; And, then she broke into laughter, &quot;yes.&quot; She was kidding and thrilled with herself at the misdirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re trying to get an evaluation by the neuropsychology group soon to figure out the exact extent of Auri&apos;s developmental delays. I think they usually do this for children with autism or behavioral issues, but they can evaluate her mentally, physically, emotionally, etc. I had to fill out a big questionnaire that was mostly irrelevant for her age, but I did this word list where I circled the words that she &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; (not just understands). It&apos;s complicated because a lot of her noises and signs are far from complete or recognizable, but I circled those that she tries to use and that she connects correctly. Her therapists often comment about how smart she is, which is a welcome observation. If she&apos;s going to have difficulty speaking, we feel confident that it won&apos;t be for lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t feel like I have it in me this month to talk enough about Max and Lennox. I recently took Max to an ENT for the third time this year to follow up about an enlarged lymph node in his neck. After finding out he&apos;s dropped to the 5th percentile in weight over the course of a year, I&apos;ve been more than stressed. I&apos;m assured that there&apos;s nothing concerning about the lymph node and that there are other explanations for his poor weight gain. It&apos;s possible that he and Lennox have been experiencing their own kind of stress. Which brings me to Lennox, my clever and courageous child happens to be my most headstrong. He started elementary school recently, and I&apos;m glad that he&apos;s enjoying it so much. I was afraid it would be another source of conflict because we seem to already have so many. I think it&apos;s obvious from the content of this blog that they don&apos;t get enough attention. Auri still commands the vast majority of my waking thoughts, but I&apos;m working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/UcMJNMACkf1VBt449&quot;&gt;Video: Max and Lennox playing outside&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure to check out Lennox&apos;s &quot;wobbly wobbly dance&quot; at 2:10.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently returned from a three week, self-imposed exile in South Florida. With Lennox starting elementary school next week, we wanted him to get up to date with the kindergarten vaccination schedule. Out of an abundance of caution, I took him and Max to stay with their grandmother for two weeks; and when the danger was gone, Natalie and Auri joined us for a family vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&quot;Can You Take Me To The Hospital?&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bad omen, the day after we arrived Max stepped on a sewing needle that went completely into his foot. With only the eye exposed, we had to actually thread it with string to pull it out. He handled it alright, but I just got this sinking feeling that things weren&apos;t going to go as well as I had hoped. A few days later, my mother in law&apos;s sister surprised me with a request to take her to the hospital due to chest pain. Less than a week later, she had open heart surgery to bypass two major arteries. Thankfully, she&apos;s doing well now, at home, and feeling better and stronger than before her surgery. But, naturally, this came as a surprise and changed the nature of our trip. Hilda had planned to spend the time with my boys while I worked, but we had to improvise a little to keep Esther company and help make sure she was taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silver lining, our family was able to stay with my aunt and uncle, unplanned, for two nights while Natalie and Auri were with us. When Esther returned from the hospital, we couldn&apos;t all fit in Hilda&apos;s house; so we asked to stay at Nancy&apos;s house. It was nice to spend so much time with them, and they were generous to open their home to my caravan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality Time with Max and Lennox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been as difficult on my boys as the rest of the family, and I&apos;m grateful that I was able to spend so much time with them. They&apos;ve been in need of attention, and I&apos;ll admit that I&apos;ve been unable or unwilling to give it to them. My anxiety has kept me emotionally paralyzed, but the distance afforded by this trip allowed me to stay more focused on their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other activities, we spent a day at CB Smith&apos;s water park. It was relieving to play with them without worrying about how Auri&apos;s doing or whether Natalie needed my attention. I was able to just run around with them, ride the slides, and goof off. I never feel comfortable doing that when Natalie&apos;s around because she&apos;s always working so hard with Auri that I feel like I need to be ready to tag in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lennox begins elementary school in a week, and I&apos;m amazed at how smart and independent he&apos;s become this year. His development has made some of our time together more difficult, but I was able to find a more positive perspective about it during this trip. Both of our boys are remarkably funny and demonstrate a depth of awareness uncommon for their ages. They made me very proud this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality Family Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Natalie and Auri finally joined us, I think we were all greatly relieved. Even though we were holding video calls every morning and evening, Auri was getting increasingly upset about our not being there. We&apos;re usually together a lot and share routines; so without the brothers for entertainment, I know that Natalie and Auri felt lonely. When they arrived, though, we were unfortunately all on edge having been apart and away from home for so long. We may have preferred to simply go home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a night or two with family, we headed to a beach condo for a few days. With mornings in the waves and afternoons in the pool, we carried a lot of gear and sunblock back and forth. Logistically, travelling together was more difficult than I had expected. However, I can see it getting easier and more manageable, enough so that I wouldn&apos;t be afraid to travel in the future. I had concerns about whether our changes would confine us to our home, but we&apos;re getting more competent and patient about handling the increased difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also learned that Auri does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; like the beach. I think she might have been too hot, but she was also not sleeping very well and seemed over it in less than an hour each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming her condition remains stable, we&apos;re going to need to adjust Auri&apos;s expectations because she&apos;s still hopelessly attached to and demanding of her mother. Natalie, thankfully, handled this well during our trip and took it in stride, keeping Auri calm and happy enough for us to enjoy our vacation. Frankly, I&apos;m not sure that this was too much unlike traveling with two children and a baby. It might be difficult, but it&apos;s still good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Developments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been reckoning lately with my feelings about Auri&apos;s development. As the months count on, we&apos;re continuing to digest how serious her condition is. This past week, a young boy that takes the sister drug to Auri&apos;s medication appears to have suffered a relapse after two years. I don&apos;t know a lot of details, but it underscores how precarious my daughter&apos;s health is and the reality that we&apos;re never going to stop being worried for her. Another parent recently described Auri as a success story, given that we intervened so early. But I&apos;m worried that you can&apos;t recover from a brain injury as quickly as you can suffer one. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;ll live with that anxiety, but there are still good things to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri&apos;s recovery, then, continues slowly. Contrary to what I&apos;ve claimed in previous months, I beginning to think that much of her gains come from simply getting older. She&apos;s maturing into a silly, sweet girl; and we continue to see slow improvements in her strength. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Auri started asking to wear bows in her hair; and Natalie&apos;s been pulling it back into a ponytail. Likewise, she likes to pick outfits and headbands and has strong opinions about what she wears. Recently, Natalie bought her a couple of little charm bracelets that she was so excited to show everyone. She&apos;s transforming, so to speak, from a baby into a little girl. I&apos;m proud of how smart, silly, and clever my boys are; but I think Auri might take the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest physical development lately has been an improvement in Auri&apos;s ability to sit. She&apos;s able to do this now for about ten minutes if we help her get into position. Though she&apos;s still using her arms for a lot of support, she&apos;s developed enough core strength to keep upright enough to play with toys. This morning, she was sitting on the couch while Max read her and Lennox a book and she was able to stay with some support and an arm rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her hands are open most of the day now too, as long as she&apos;s relaxed. She&apos;s still grasping things poorly, but I can see this getting manageable as she gets older. With concentration, she uses an imperfect pincer grasp and can pick up cheerios and other small foods to eat. I&apos;ve tried to remember to grab a better picture of this, but by the time I grab my camera she&apos;s usually back to raking things again. As a young child, I believe she defaults to the path of least resistance without consideration of the value of practice. Still, I catch her sometimes doing really well, as in this picture of her picking up coffee creamers. She does this when she needs to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her speech, I feel differently week by week. Most of the past month I&apos;ve been worried that she&apos;s been plateauing. But this past week or two, in a burst much like the other stop and start developments she&apos;s been experiencing, Auri started mimicking and matching sounds to her sign language. The range of sounds she can make are still very restricted, but she&apos;s matching the number of syllables a word requires to her attempts. And, last evening they were pretending to be chickens, where imitating animals had seemed out of reach. While we were on vacation she was saying &quot;oh no&quot;, not perfectly, but with enough enunciation of the &quot;oh&quot; that she sounded like a different person to me. Every evening we say &quot;nigh nigh&quot; (sometimes more like &quot;na na&quot;), but &lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; it comes out almost perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re still riding the ups and downs of blood tests, with Auri having her lowest neutrophil count this month since we began treatment. I&apos;m hopeful it resolves itself, but neutropenia is one of the most common side effects of the drug and can cause considerable risk of infection. She&apos;s been flirting with neutropenia that usually resolves by follow up, and I hope that means that it will again. We&apos;re monitoring monthly now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Unique Future&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I spent a bit of time trying to understand the classification systems used to score children and adults with disabilities. This is how the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) describes children &lt;strong&gt;under two years of age&lt;/strong&gt;. Note that a higher score describes a more severe physical disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEVEL I: Infants move in and out of sitting and floor sit with both hands free to manipulate objects. Infants crawl on hands and
knees, pull to stand and take steps holding on to furniture. Infants walk between 18 months and 2 years of age without the need for
any assistive mobility device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEVEL II: Infants maintain floor sitting but may need to use their hands for support to maintain balance. Infants creep on their
stomach or crawl on hands and knees. Infants may pull to stand and take steps holding on to furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEVEL III: Infants maintain floor sitting when the low back is supported. Infants roll and creep forward on their stomachs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEVEL IV: Infants have head control but trunk support is required for floor sitting. Infants can roll to supine and may roll to prone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LEVEL V: Physical impairments limit voluntary control of movement. Infants are unable to maintain antigravity head and trunk
postures in prone and sitting. Infants require adult assistance to roll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this places Auri in level 3, but on the border with level 4. She has a couple of months to figure it out. Interestingly, the group leading AGS research presented some slides this year detailing these scores across their patients. Remember that a high score is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;. You can see that the majority of children with AGS are so disabled that they max out these scoring systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Auri where I think she is, I believe it places her somewhere in the middle of that slope, in the lucky 25%. The goal will be to help her accelerate her development, if possible, and improve her scores rather than remain on the same growth curve. In my last post I described one possibility, a cellular therapy using mesenchymal stromal cells. Auri&apos;s doctor agreed this month to write a proposal and seek FDA approval to make it happen. Forgive me for getting all researchy, but I wanted to show how significant this &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be. Chen et al. (2013), using a &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; different method, demonstrated &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; improvements in gross motor function scores for children with cerebral palsy transplanted with mesenchymal stromal cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These charts show improvements in motor function scores for children that started in different GMFCS levels. Children that started in level 4, for example, achieved motor function scores that would place them in level 3. Without this treatment, children with CP will develop, but much more slowly. So I hope, perhaps unreasonably, that this will be approved for Auri and change her future for the better. Looking ahead, these are descriptions of GMFCS levels 3 and 4 for children &lt;strong&gt;between their 12th and 18th birthday&lt;/strong&gt;. While her future will be unique, the degree of independence that Auri will be able to achieve will rest a lot on what happens in the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level III: Youth are capable of walking using a hand-held mobility device. Compared to individuals in other levels, youth in Level III
demonstrate more variability in methods of mobility depending on physical ability and environmental and personal factors. When
seated, youth may require a seat belt for pelvic alignment and balance. Sit-to-stand and floor-to-stand transfers require physical
assistance from a person or support surface. At school, youth may self-propel a manual wheelchair or use powered mobility.
Outdoors and in the community, youth are transported in a wheelchair or use powered mobility. Youth may walk up and down stairs
holding onto a railing with supervision or physical assistance. Limitations in walking may necessitate adaptations to enable
participation in physical activities and sports including self-propelling a manual wheelchair or powered mobility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Level IV: Youth use wheeled mobility in most settings. Youth require adaptive seating for pelvic and trunk control. Physical
assistance from 1 or 2 persons is required for transfers. Youth may support weight with their legs to assist with standing transfers.
Indoors, youth may walk short distances with physical assistance, use wheeled mobility, or, when positioned, use a body support
walker. Youth are physically capable of operating a powered wheelchair. When a powered wheelchair is not feasible or available,
youth are transported in a manual wheelchair. Limitations in mobility necessitate adaptations to enable participation in physical
activities and sports, including physical assistance and/or powered mobility. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re finally achieving a peace that has been hard won. The past month has brought more of the same kind of waves that have made this year so difficult and stressful, but we&apos;re sailing through them with less concern for the ship. We&apos;re finding peace in the midst of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And Happiness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a lot of happiness in our home now, maybe more than existed in December. It&apos;s complicated and we&apos;re certainly suffering in a lot of ways; but we&apos;ve been looking at ourselves and our family more positively. I feel as if we&apos;ve had a near death experience, for which I&apos;m painfully troubled and confusingly grateful. With my father&apos;s words of encouragement this past Sunday after he headed back home, I was reminded of my panic in January. I had warned him then that he should visit immediately, because I was uncertain about how much longer Auri had remaining. Having lived with that pain for months, I&apos;m so grateful for how quickly it&apos;s subsiding. We can play, work, and love now with confidence that there will be more tomorrow. And with every day of play, work, and love, we&apos;re coming together. I&apos;ve been reflecting about how differently I love my wife and children after having gone through this, and I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have measured up without having faced the threat of losing it all. There were a number of weeks where the odds and genetics favored one of my boys suffering as well. And, it seemed that all possibilities lead to their ruin. I&apos;m a lot happier with this outcome. Go figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to share how excited these boys were to get their new bunk beds. When a neighbor offered them up for free, I jumped at the opportunity. Both of these kids couldn&apos;t contain themselves and spent days in their room hanging sheets and pretending to camp. In many ways I think they&apos;re happier. Though we struggle at times to manage our behavior (Natalie and I included), the acute, underlying stress that&apos;s responsible for our transgressions has been largely alleviated. Max and Lennox will play outside again, have fun at the pool, and are returning to normal. They have many things that make them happy, and their expressions of joy are helping to replenish our strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a busy month! We&apos;ve had visits from Natalie&apos;s mother, my father, and my cousin and her family. When I went back to pull pictures for this post, I was surprised to see how much we had done. Together with her two daughters and husband, my cousin came from Michigan during the work week. I had to partially focus on work, but the kids had a fantastic time together. Since Ava and Marin are older, Max and Lennox play &quot;up&quot;, in that they play and talk more maturely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natalie&apos;s mother, Hilda, also came to visit. She spent a lot of time with Max and Lennox, and I hope she enjoyed them because she&apos;s about to get a lot more. We decided on traveling to Florida for a few weeks, and Hilda is going to help me by watching Max and Lennox while I work remotely. My next update should include some fun pictures of the beach vacation we&apos;re planning on the tail end of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, my dad came this past week. We saw him both in January, before we knew exactly what terrible thing was happening, and in Philadelphia in March, where we travelled after starting Auri&apos;s medicine to consult with an expert. Fortunately, we were able to do fun things like visit the big Raleigh sunflower field, spend a day at the pool, and go out for pizza and ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Independence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, I wrote about milestones and how we don&apos;t seem to have any more. Well, this past month I&apos;ve decided to set goals instead. For much longer than me, Natalie has been resolute in her belief that Auri will be walking. I think she might, but I have a different belief now. I&apos;m certain that Auri will be independent. I don&apos;t know how long it will take, and I don&apos;t know what it will look like; but Auri will be independent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, I want to be alone with Auri one morning each week. I&apos;ve been taking her to the park and playground early to beat the heat on Sundays. After everything she&apos;s been through, she&apos;s been overly attached to Natalie. We haven&apos;t wanted to push her too hard to break out of it, so we&apos;ve fallen into a division of labor that means Natalie handles almost everything with Auri. If mom&apos;s around, Auri doesn&apos;t really want much to do with me; but if I take her out alone, she shares a lighter and more playful side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/c9oUuYkC16G29Ndo9&quot;&gt;Riding the playground horse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/9wCNZricqfgLFfUr8&quot;&gt;Digging in the sandbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question remains: how are we going to make this happen? How do we help Auri recover and develop enough to take care of herself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recovery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have seen a video I shared of &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/8YBqoSLP6a4YjaCLA&quot;&gt;Auri dancing in her stander&lt;/a&gt;. Just a week prior, Auri&apos;s doctor said something to the effect of wanting to see her develop more core strength. A week later at physical therapy, Natalie and the therapist decided to see how she handled a &lt;em&gt;half&lt;/em&gt; stander that wouldn&apos;t support her core. Surprise! She nailed it. While we&apos;ve been anxiously wondering how much she&apos;ll improve, she&apos;s been quietly building strength. All the therapy and exercise we&apos;re forcing her to do is paying off, and I&apos;m beginning to see clear and obvious signs of improvement that only her therapists were able to notice previously. It seems like she has stepped up and impressed us whenever we&apos;ve begun to get discouraged or worried about something. So, we&apos;re not only keeping the faith but we&apos;re doubling down on work and exercise. We&apos;re asking more of her and raising our expectations. I recently started forcing Auri to walk out of anywhere that we visit together. I think Natalie thought I was crazy at first, but I noticed that she recently started doing it too. We might be the girl&apos;s legs right now, but we&apos;re going to get her used to doing it herself. And we&apos;re making her play by herself more often, forcing her to &lt;em&gt;figure it out&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/nC3gxAZkMQNNpdh4A&quot;&gt;Auri playing by herself sitting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/PirCsPxmGqtV1GPt8&quot;&gt;Auri playing by herself standing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also keep telling people how lucky we and Auri seem to be within the context of an extremely unlucky situation. We are really fortunate to have Auri&apos;s doctor, and I recently asked her about secondary therapies to support Auri&apos;s recovery. Dr. Kurtzberg happens to be a pioneer in the field of cellular therapies, having recently experimented with direct infusion of mesenchymal stromal cells for children with cerebral palsy. I&apos;m under the impression that she&apos;s one of the few stem cell experts doing this, and that &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we decide to give it a shot, Auri will be given a remarkable opportunity under an individualized study. You can&apos;t just call up a pharmacy and make this happen. And, I have queries out about human growth hormone and a delivery of CBD arriving any day. We&apos;re starting to do research to figure out what else we can do to maximize her rehabilitation. In September we&apos;re meeting with a pediatric physiatrist, a rehabilitation doctor that specializes in managing therapeutic recovery for children with spinal and nerve injuries. And, maybe by next time we&apos;ll have something else in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone is enthusiastic about Auri&apos;s condition, and we all see the obvious potential for recovery.  I feel like we&apos;re racing headlong into the new phase I talked about in my last post. We might be a few years away from major achievements, but the significant improvements of the past month or two mean that we can hold Auri with one arm and afford her some independent play. These mean &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; considering Auri suffers from a disease measured in part by whether or not she can smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&apos;t seem to quit! Natalie&apos;s sister and mother were kind enough to take Max and Lennox to the movie theater with their cousins, but by the end of the day I heard that the cousins tested positive for Strep A at the doctor. Unsurprisingly, Lennox woke up the following day complaining that his throat hurt. Although he tested negative (maybe because it was too soon), both he and Max developed rashes and sores and complained about not feeling well for over a week. Like every time prior, Natalie and I did our best to keep the healthy separated from the ill. And like every time prior, I ended up sick too. This time, however, I was the only one to get a fever. I laid in bed for a few days wondering what the hell has happened to us. We just keep getting sick. I&apos;ve been told it&apos;s the stress, and I believe it. But, I don&apos;t care. I just want it to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Harvest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spring was supposed to be the year that I finally finished my master piece garden. That didn&apos;t quite work out, but thankfully the fruit trees don&apos;t care! They&apos;ve been digging roots for over five years and mostly take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We snagged a few freezer bags worth of peaches that made their way into some unofficial Howling Cow ice cream, courtesy of our friends. And, we harvested a great deal of figs this year. All the kids helped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/UuVxdDiPoKA1JwjQ6&quot;&gt;washing figs&lt;/a&gt; that made their way into some jam and baked desserts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to get involved in the AGS and rare disease community in the coming months and years. I feel the need to apply myself to something more important than business software. A couple weeks ago, I contacted the AGS non-profit to see if there was any way I could help. Since I have some background in computational biology, I thought that I might have something unique to offer. We&apos;ll see what I can do in the near term, but I&apos;m &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that I&apos;ll be redirecting myself in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the facebook, there&apos;s an AGS family group that I&apos;ve mentioned before. Through it, I sometimes learn about other children with stories similar to Auri&apos;s. In the past month, I&apos;ve been made aware of two more children whose disease presented sometime between 1 and 1.5 years of age that are doing well on baricitinib. They&apos;ve been treated for about a year already, and they&apos;ve both seen significant improvements. Their outcomes and severity of injury, however, are different. One can speak freely and naturally, despite having lost it all for over six months. Neither can walk right now, and I fear both have had more severe loss of motor function. Both had interventions within a few months. As far as I can tell, Auri may have had the fastest intervention of the children being treated with this drug, getting diagnosed and treated in under two months. Unfortunately, that doesn&apos;t seem to dictate what will happen because there&apos;s so much variability in the disease. It does give me hope, though, that she could have one of the more remarkable recoveries. In the coming years, we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's First Milestone]]></title><description><![CDATA[The 15th of June marked four months of Aurelia's treatment with Baricitinib.

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15th of June marked four months of Aurelia&apos;s treatment with Baricitinib. When her treatment started, we were given the expectation that it might take this long to know whether Auri would tolerate this drug and respond to it favorably. Since she began, we&apos;ve been to Duke every two weeks and subjected her to regular blood draws and lab work. Well, it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; gone well enough and we&apos;re celebrating this milestone and spacing out her followups moving forward. My understanding of her condition and my expectations and hopes for the future have become more grounded. Without a doubt, we and Auri remain remarkably fortunate that she&apos;s either in the minority of AGS victims with some semblance of normalcy or that this drug and her treatment have saved her life. Although I have my suspicions, we don&apos;t know which it is. It also doesn&apos;t seem to matter very much right now. Auri and the ensemble of professionals that work with her day in and day out communicate their optimism that the small steps she&apos;s taking and subtle improvements we&apos;re observing are laying the foundation for her continued recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weathering Storms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Auri failed to bounce back from a febrile illness. We believe this precipitated her decline, and research into her disease seems to support this as a plausible trigger. Through January and February, it seemed like we couldn&apos;t shake our constantly recurring colds, each coinciding with some loss of skill or increased difficulty of Auri&apos;s. For that reason, we&apos;ve been anxious every time one of our kids gets sick. We don&apos;t know whether another illness could cause a disease flare. Thankfully, we haven&apos;t observed one. In the past four months, Auri has had a few colds, some severe, some less so. This past month, we had three consecutive weekends where one of our kids was sick with a significant fever. Max, in fact, peaked at 104° F in the middle of the night. We weren&apos;t able to keep Auri from getting sick, but she was spared what Max and Lennox experienced (sleeping in the bathroom, chills, etc). However, she developed an eye infection for the second time, this episode of conjunctivitis less serious than the first in March.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positive in this is that Auri &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; gotten sick, no more or less severely than in the past. And, She&apos;s done &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. We don&apos;t know if that will always be the case, but it&apos;s a promising sign that either the drug is working or that she&apos;s in some kind of remission. I&apos;m speculating here, but I think the illness that really triggered her disease was &quot;mono&quot; (EBV or mononucleosis). Most people contract the virus by adulthood, but she tested positive in February at a year of age. It&apos;s a nasty virus that makes your immune system go a bit nuts and then stays latent in your cells for the remainder of your life. You fight it for a few months after the initial infection, which might roughly align with Auri&apos;s period of decline and stabilization. I hope that she never experiences a relapse, but maybe this is a sign that it would take something more than the common cold to cause her issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in February when I was frantically trying to find a doctor that would treat Auri, I had spoken to some parents of affected children. One asked me, referring to Auri, something like, &quot;what skills does she still have?&quot; That hit me kind of sideways. I wasn&apos;t in denial exactly, but my daughter went from being 100% normal to significantly disabled in the course of just a few weeks and she was getting worse. Everything happened so quickly that I&apos;m not confident that I can objectively say how bad things really were. And, Natalie and I remember things a little differently. My recollection isn&apos;t perfect, but I did keep a journal that tells me that things are what I would describe as &lt;em&gt;qualitatively&lt;/em&gt; different now compared to February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to calibrate, on February 12th I wrote the following (and keep in mind I was desperately looking for and granting her positives):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/15 Positives:&lt;/strong&gt; Understood new word balloon. Bringing spoon to mouth to feed herself. Signaling with head nods and pointing. Socially engaged. Loud cry, voice, and cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/15 Negatives:&lt;/strong&gt; Difficulty with and refusing water. Less trunk strength, not sitting up when carried. Less head strength, leaning when eating. Trouble getting arm out from under when rolling over. Exaggerated startle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, you can watch her &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/gfnQrzE8iC5moMPD7&quot;&gt;walking in the Hallway&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/NLPoxrj1Xd6pXCLY9&quot;&gt;playing in the grocery cart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/uFspcjRdAFTHAwCw6&quot;&gt;swinging at the playground&lt;/a&gt;. You can see for yourself that she has challenges, but many children with her disease would find these activities impossible without tremendous support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure what, but it says something that I celebrated Auri pointing clearly with her index finger by taking a picture. Auri&apos;s hands are still pretty tight and she has difficulty rotating them and isolating movements in her fingers. But I&apos;ll be damned if I didn&apos;t think this was a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also seems to be developing more consistent strength in her back. I won&apos;t pretend that &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/AjVPBh7LunqvsFdG6&quot;&gt;Auri sitting in a highchair&lt;/a&gt; looks great, but what you wouldn&apos;t notice without me pointing it out is that she&apos;s &lt;em&gt;not in a five point harness&lt;/em&gt;. I&apos;ve wondered whether Natalie and I are just becoming more comfortable with her circumstances and allowing more stuff like this, but the professionals have noted some gradual improvement too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With liquids, we&apos;ve begun a step protocol to gradually reduce the amount of thickener we used to make it safe for Auri to drink. We have the numbers on our chalkboard and increase the amount of water in her cup by 5% every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, this has gone without incident; and we&apos;ve simultaneously increased the overall amount of water that she&apos;s drinking. She has a slow flow straw cup, and it takes her more time to drink. If we&apos;re patient and encouraging, she&apos;ll keep going and get a lot more than we&apos;ve given her the opportunity to in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With communication, I&apos;ve wondered if we&apos;re seeing things slow down. It&apos;s obvious that Auri&apos;s understanding us as well as we would expect, but she hasn&apos;t been using a whole lot of new sounds or words. Rather, she&apos;s been picking up a few hand signs and gestures. This past month she added &quot;please&quot;, &quot;help&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;all done&quot;, and &quot;water&quot; in her modified, imperfect sign language. Like most kids, she defaults to yelling at us to get what she wants; but it&apos;s clear that she understands the gesture and the purpose for using it. With her speech therapist, Natalie&apos;s singing a lot of songs with gestures (like the itsy bitsy spider) and Auri&apos;s picking up some of the movements. Auri&apos;s therapist encouragingly reassures us that any kind of expression is promising and that she sees Auri continuing to develop. I know that some children with Auri&apos;s disease can&apos;t speak even though they have less severe disabilities. In these cases it&apos;s not an intellectual problem but something to do with injury in the parts of the brain that either control the fine movements of speech or the planning that translates the idea into the movement. I have very little idea of what to expect, but she&apos;s learning new things and I still hear her babbling in her crib and car seat sometimes. I bet that Natalie will correct me when she reads this, but that she will &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to says something. This is one of those categories that I find hard to anticipate, but everyone that works with Auri remarks about how &lt;em&gt;opinionated&lt;/em&gt; she is and that she communicates what she does and doesn&apos;t want pretty effectively. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Auri will speak clearly or not, I&apos;m confident that she&apos;s going to be intellectually normal and communicating one way or another. &lt;em&gt;edit: Natalie asked me to emphasize how important and promising it is that Auri is signing to communicate. I agree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatigue is still a bit of a problem, but I don&apos;t know what to say about it. Auri&apos;s being pushed to do a lot of physical and mental activities that she finds difficult. Everything is hard work for her now, and she has mornings or afternoons where she just looks worn out. I&apos;m pretty certain that this is normal for anybody with a significant brain injury, but it causes me a lot of anxiety. I&apos;m at a distance with work, and I can&apos;t always see the day or week as a whole. I come home to see Auri tired and weak some days, unaware that she walked all over the damn playground that day. Fortunately, Natalie has a much more positive and optimistic perspective. I trust that she&apos;s able to see the big picture, and she tells me that the big picture looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Growth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this chaos &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; began, we had taken Auri to her pediatrician at the start of the year with our concerns. At that appointment we learned that Auri hadn&apos;t gained any weight over the preceding month. That&apos;s a bad sign for any child, and for Auri it was a signal that something was terribly wrong. There&apos;s a big dip in Auri&apos;s weight chart at 15 months, right when shit really hit the fan. This was &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; before starting treatment, when she was choking on food and water and suffered the worst of her regressions. She was persistently sick and got very thin. She went as low as the 13th percentile. Four months later, she&apos;s eating and drinking better and holding the 30th percentile. Within the first few weeks of treatment she became remarkably enthusiastic about eating and quickly regained a lot of weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This length chart tells a story that only Natalie and I would immediately recognize. You can see how inconsistent the measurements are, and it&apos;s a result of how spastic Auri&apos;s legs became. It&apos;s difficult to measure her length carefully because she has trouble relaxing her feet and legs when she&apos;s stressed. You can imagine that she doesn&apos;t like laying on a table with people trying to push her. I don&apos;t know what this chart will look like in the future, but it&apos;s very likely that Auri has suffered some growth delays. I imagine that recovery here would take a bit more time, but I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve observed anything serious.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Teeth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m still genuinely worried about Auri&apos;s dental development. She didn&apos;t have any teeth until &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; after starting her drug therapy when she got her bottom and top incisors. Before we knew that she had this disease, we had calmed ourselves by learning that some children just &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get them this late. However, abnormal bone and teeth development has been associated with Auri&apos;s disease. Some children with AGS get their teeth late, out of order, and have major issues with them. When they do, it&apos;s usually a sign of other disease characteristics that we havent&apos; observed in Auri like osteoporosis or hardening of the heart. When her front teeth came in first, I breathed a sigh of relief; but since, her upper first molars have jumped the queue a bit and have begun to come in before her canines. For now, her teeth appear normal. They may be coming in &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; out of the expected order, but it isn&apos;t what I was worried to see (back molars months before front teeth). I worry a lot, but in the last four months her teeth have started to erupt. It&apos;s a good sign, even though teething has added a lot of stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Next Milestones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t know what milestone will come next, but there are a few things that we&apos;re working toward. Auri has gotten a little stronger at sitting and she&apos;s begun to adapt by supporting herself with her arms. She&apos;s going to need strength and coordination in her arms, shoulders, and back to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, we&apos;ve been encouraging Auri to &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ly89goQNamnNhNUd7&quot;&gt;take steps using her arms for support&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to make her &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/y4WuXXpbNW8MJqfX7&quot;&gt;walk as she will need to with a gait trainer&lt;/a&gt;. If she can ever walk independently it will take a lot more time, but we&apos;ll celebrate even the smallest and fewest steps with a walker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we&apos;re going to keep marching with our fingers crossed toward regular water. The clinical research, provided by Auri&apos;s feeding therapist, showed promising results. The majority of children that they did this with managed to wean off thickeners entirely, and all the children that didn&apos;t still achieved a significant reduction in the amount of thickener they required. Auri has been doing well and drinking more, and we&apos;re going to celebrate every successful step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Other Family Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Lennox starting school full time at the end of the summer and Max having finished kindergarten, we decided to keep them both home. I think that they&apos;re going to do a short summer camp session, but they&apos;ll mostly be home with Natalie and Auri for the summer. While I&apos;ve been able to take advantage of my profession&apos;s flexibility, I can&apos;t be there for the daily therapy appointments, the scrambling lunches, hectic nap times, and all of the chaos that a normal family with three small children experiences. For those reasons, we looked for somebody to help out a couple of days a week. We&apos;re fortunate that a young woman in university who had been babysitting for us was able to make that schedule work for the summer. After having tried it out a few times, I kept hearing from both Natalie and my boys how helpful and fun she&apos;s been. I&apos;ve witnessed it myself now, and can share that we&apos;re incredibly lucky to have her help this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other friends and family have thrown in their time, friendship, and &lt;em&gt;meals&lt;/em&gt;. Recently, Natalie&apos;s sister watched four kids for the entire morning (all three of mine and one of hers) so that Natalie could have a spa day. I don&apos;t think we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; this kind of support until we get it and it makes me realize how thin we&apos;re stretched with cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc. And, speaking of laundry, I haven&apos;t known how to properly thank my neighbor Pam for washing and folding our laundry every week. I was so embarrassed at first about the idea of it, but this may be the single most helpful thing that anybody has done for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps contradicting what I said about Max and Lennox at home this summer, I may take them for an extended visit with their grandmother in Florida. Since Lennox is starting elementary school, we want him to fulfill the kindergarten vaccination schedule early. Auri &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; get a number of important vaccines because of her disease and drug therapy, and it&apos;s important that our children (and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; friends and family) are fully up to date with theirs. But, Lennox will be getting a number of weakened (but live) vaccines that mean it&apos;s best for us to keep him separated from Auri. I have no idea if we&apos;re overreacting, but specialists have been in agreement that we should be cautious and conservative when possible. I&apos;m aware that anti-vaxxers have grossly over stated the consequences of &quot;vaccine shedding,&quot; but you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; shed small amounts of the virus for about two weeks and Auri has multiple risk factors and unknowns that make it best to avoid. I&apos;m roughly planning to take the boys down there, work remotely for a bit, and have Natalie and Auri join us for an end of the summer beach vacation before returning. I&apos;m looking forward to time alone with my boys because this year hasn&apos;t been kind to them either. Upcoming visits from my dad, mother-in-law, and cousin will help cheer them up, I&apos;m sure. Other than those visits and the aforementioned trip, we don&apos;t have any additional plans this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? Natalie and I celebrated nine years of marriage at the end of May. The world keeps turning and surprises abound. We&apos;re trying to make the best of it, and I think we&apos;re doing a pretty good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slowing Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading in to Mother&apos;s Day, I think Natalie and I had been feeling a little defeated. For whatever reason, Auri seems to be feeling the same way. She&apos;s been adjusting (or perhaps adapting) to her circumstances, but this means she&apos;s been less enthusiastic about the hard work needed to regain the skills she&apos;s lost. Watching her cousin Tom crawl around the room like Speedy Gonzalez, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/T1YRhQUUoD2Xv2YAA&quot;&gt;struggling to army crawl&lt;/a&gt;; but she was at least trying. It hurts to see her like this, but not nearly as much as it hurts to see her give up. Both Natalie and I scrutinize everything Auri does, so this decreasing enthusiasm has caused a great deal of anxiety and panic in us. We&apos;ve developed (and fought) doubts about Auri&apos;s trajectory, and we&apos;ve been worried about backsliding. I can&apos;t emphasize enough how deeply this anxiety has embedded itself into our lives. The only cure for this is time. I keep saying it and hoping that we get through this year quickly, but I&apos;m trying a lot harder to make sure I don&apos;t have my eyes closed. We began Auri&apos;s treatment looking up, possibly naive about the long, difficult road ahead. I believe that we&apos;re finally coming to terms with the kind of parents and family that we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping Steady&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectively, though, I think Auri is still improving, just slowly. Auri&apos;s therapists have observed and shared some subtle but important things like Auri lifting a leg while standing and shifting her weight, having more strength in her arms for maintaining balance, and using new consonants and expressions to communicate. We hoped for more, but I maintain the belief that we&apos;ll feel much better a year from now. This will not speed up in a day or a month. To be honest, it might not ever. But, we&apos;re moving forward. I&apos;ll never forget the fear of watching it move backward. This is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the opportunity to take Auri to physical therapy yesterday, and I was amazed at how hard she was working. I&apos;ve never pushed her so much at home. She needs a lot of support, of course, but she&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/8dUh4JHg3tmqSEwz8&quot;&gt;climbing up slides&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;recovering&quot; from different positions, building core strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regaining Skills Will Take Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared this picture on the Facebook recently. It had a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; profound effect on me emotionally. Auri can&apos;t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do this, but Natalie captured something that she might be able to do with confidence in the future. She&apos;s working hard, it&apos;s just going to take a lot of time. I grabbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/itMC9qTjfSxtUX1h8&quot;&gt;a video of her practicing in her walker&lt;/a&gt;, and you can see how hard this is going to be. It will take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All is Not Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/wkQ1Dcciko56ysqQA&quot;&gt;Playing with the computer at the doctor&apos;s office&lt;/a&gt;, I think you can see that Auri has a reasonable future. It might not be the one any of us had wished for her, but Auri&apos;s going to be alright. She can sit at a table, mess around with stuff, push buttons when she focuses. As she gets older, I&apos;d expect her to have more patience and concentration. It should help a lot. At a year and a half of age, she&apos;s just throwing herself at whatever she wants to do. Eventually she&apos;ll plan and practice, and she&apos;s going to do everything more effectively. This is a far cry from what I had been worried about. When this all happened and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; hit rock bottom, I kept begging and pleading that I&apos;d at least be able to have a conversation with her in a few years. Now I think I&apos;ll be able to. Our daughter has lost a lot, but not everything. She may very well tell me in a few years that I was overreacting. We may &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/k2g9Lkowk8bdQrUg8&quot;&gt;swing&lt;/a&gt; through highs and lows, but I&apos;m grateful for where we are and what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Swimming!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve recently looked into aquatic physical therapy, thinking that it would be really beneficial for Auri. Thankfully, our neighborhood pool opened this weekend and showed us just how great it will be. On Saturday, Auri had a fantastic time &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ggyTYnXvekduKnny9&quot;&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, splashing, and thrashing about. We&apos;ve spent a couple of weeks starting to feel disappointed and worried that she&apos;s hasn&apos;t been trying as hard, but then I saw and felt her moving in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Onward, Max!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we celebrate Max&apos;s sixth birthday, and I&apos;ve never been prouder of him. He&apos;s really the most thoughtful and kind hearted person. And, he&apos;s too smart. Walking the neighborhood this week, Lennox started talking about how it was night time because the sun was &quot;going down.&quot; Max let him know that the sun never actually &lt;em&gt;moves&lt;/em&gt;. It stays put while the Earth rotates. I&apos;ve been saying stuff like this to him for years, and he keeps showing me that he not only listens but understands. He&apos;s a great kid. Here he is helping Lennox water the berries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives flipped upside down, but I&apos;m grateful to have such a strong partner. She&apos;s become a veritable super mom, carrying my daughter and my children through insanely difficult times. She carries me too, but that&apos;s not what today is about. That&apos;s not what this post is about. This is about how grateful I am that my daughter has a mother so committed to helping us achieve her best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Auri first started her troubles, I fell into a dark and sorrowful place. Natalie kept going. She never gave up hope, and she continues to look forward with an optimism that I know will give Auri every opportunity. Where my back is sore from thirty minutes of playing, Natalie won&apos;t stop walking with Auri until the sun goes down. She&apos;s up early every morning, making sure my daughter gets as much out of the day as possible. Natalie has grown in the past few months and blossomed into somebody really special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have never have guessed where we would be, but thank goodness for such a wonderful mother.&lt;/p&gt;

I&apos;m leaving it around and archiving it for posterity. I wrote this in March of 2019, just after my daughter started this medicine and just after she stabilized from acute and severe developmental regression. I had little information and even less experience to share.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am not a doctor. I may have mis-represented a doctor&apos;s opinion and recommendations with the following. I&apos;m a parent that became obsessed with helping a daughter, partially blind to the risks of what I&apos;m writing about. You can read about my daughter&apos;s outcome on this blog, but remember that this is an anecdote, not evidence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your child has just been diagnosed with AGS. It may turn out to be mild, it may turn out to be severe. If you did genetic testing it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be early; if so, work &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt; (it took me another month after diagnosis to get the pieces together and my daughter lost skills all the while). There are not any effective, textbook treatments for AGS. However, there have been some studies showing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_kinase_inhibitor&quot;&gt;JAK inhibition&lt;/a&gt; to provide systemic benefits. AGS is an auto-inflammatory disease, and JAK inhibition appears to disrupt and quiet the immune signaling feedback loop that causes the brain and other organs to become chronically inflamed. The studies have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that it can &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; neurological damage, partially because they have not had many (maybe only a couple) children with AGS join their studies early enough. In at least two cases I&apos;ve heard of, it has failed to prevent further episodes (possibly due to the severity of the child&apos;s disease). In my daughter&apos;s case, it &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to have halted her regression before it became severe. I believe that it would have worked earlier if we had the opportunity. Its effectiveness may be directly related to the severity of your child&apos;s disease. &lt;em&gt;This has risks, but there is no other intervention a the moment&lt;/em&gt;. The principal investigators will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say that this is the right thing to do. At least two children have passed away while being treated with this drug, but I believe they had risk factors due to their advanced disease. If your child is strong and healthy, then they may be in a better position to take these risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check with &lt;a href=&quot;https://vanderverlab.research.chop.edu/&quot;&gt;Dr. Adeline Vanderver&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/leukodystrophy-center&quot;&gt;Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia&apos;s Leukodystrophy Center&lt;/a&gt; to see if they have an open clinical trial using baricitinib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original, closed compassionate use trial is here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580&quot;&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The upcoming clinical trial appears to be here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554&quot;&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no clinical trial available to you, it may still be possible to get this drug. At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglia.org/2019gliaconference&quot;&gt;2019 GLIA Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Vanderver and Dr. Adang struck a tone that I would interpret as opening the door for possible collaboration with your doctor. My family and a handful of others have made this therapy happen without CHOP (due to timing and circumstances), but it was difficult. There are a few major hurdles to overcome if you&apos;re trying to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drug Access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clinical Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing Interferon Score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insurance Coverage for the Drug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drug Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, &lt;em&gt;baricitinib&lt;/em&gt; has the most relevant and promising research. In the U.S. both baricitinib and ruxolitinib are approved by the F.D.A. for something else and your doctor &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; prescribe them &quot;off-label&quot; for whatever they want. They will be &lt;em&gt;nervous&lt;/em&gt; about doing so, but it&apos;s still possible. If you&apos;re outside of the U.S., your choice might be constrained by your government or health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these drugs have had promising research. Ruxolitinib has been used for treating AGS in only a few cases. Baricitinib has had larger studies done, perhaps with more depth. Dr. Goldbach-Manksy at the NIH has done diligent studies of the drug, working towards approval of the drug for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983&quot;&gt;&quot;orphaned diseases&quot;&lt;/a&gt; CANDLE and SAVI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026004/&quot;&gt;JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib in the treatment of autoinflammatory interferonopathies
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134648&quot;&gt;Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Proposed Dosing of the Oral JAK1 and JAK2 Inhibitor Baricitinib in Pediatric and Young Adult CANDLE and SAVI Patients.
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find that these papers reference work by Dr. Crow and others in establishing the theory for using JAK inhibitors to treat &quot;inteferonopathies.&quot; Follow these references or make your doctor aware of them. I don&apos;t know whether ruxolitinib has demonstrated the same level of safety, but it&apos;s well understood that it has a very similar interaction profile. Both drugs pretty much inhibit the same kinases with the same specificity. Dr. Crow has communicated more discouragement to me about ruxolitinib than excitement, but CHOP (and Dr. Vanderver&apos;s) conclusions with baricitinib appear to be more encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not involved in a clinical research study, you will have some trouble getting the drug. This drug isn&apos;t available in your neighborhood pharmacy. It was not available in our hospital. It had to be ordered and shipped to us overnight from a specialty pharmacy. Many insurance companies have their own. We initially ordered from Kroger Specialty pharmacy. You will have to pay out of pocket for at last a month or two, and it may cost you between four and six thousand dollars a month until you achieve insurance approval (I&apos;ve provided the letter I wrote to get approval below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need active monitoring by a doctor. This drug not only disrupts the immune system&apos;s alarm signals; it also disrupts signals your body uses to control the production of white blood cells and red blood cells and growth hormones. You will likely need to have blood tests run every couple of weeks for a few months to ensure that it does not suppress &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; sets of white blood cells or cause any other organ problems. Your child will be at an increased risk for not only catching viral infections but also for &lt;em&gt;reactivation&lt;/em&gt; of viruses that were dormant. Your doctor &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do a comprehensive screening for all kinds of viruses and perform periodic follow ups to ensure that your child remains healthy. In particular, BK Virus, which can attack and destroy the kidneys, has been seen to re-activate due to the drug&apos;s suppression of the immune system and possibly due to its excretion by the kidneys. A child in Dr. Goldbach-Mansky&apos;s study &lt;em&gt;died&lt;/em&gt; from BK related nephropathy. Her publications establish a safety and monitoring protocol that includes regular testing of a number of problematic viruses. They concluded that this therapy was &lt;em&gt;safe enough&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps a commentary on the risk/benefit analysis in the context of the two devastating  diseases they were focused on treating (CANDLE and SAVI).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your average neurologist may not be in a position to offer this kind of clinical care. If you&apos;re doing this outside of clinical research studies, your doctor may need to exercise an abundance of caution. They will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have experience with this drug, and the small amount of evidence of its safety does not apply to children. You will need to find a brave doctor in a position to provide this kind of care for an at risk child. In our case, we&apos;re working with the Bone Marrow Transplant group. They have a 24/7 clinic where they monitor and help children that are undergoing treatments that have a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; stronger suppressive effect on their immune systems. At our hospital, this was the perfect group and the only one in a position to help us. They would not have been involved nor even aware of my daughter&apos;s condition or circumstances if I hadn&apos;t contacted them directly. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You will need to become the mediator for a number of different kinds of doctors to make this happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing Interferon Score&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find the optimal dosage with minimal side effects, your doctor will need to send blood samples to one of the clinical research labs in a position to do this testing. This test measures the activity of genes that are stimulated by the disease&apos;s immune dysregulation. Increased activity of these genes has been established (in research) as a strong biomarker for AGS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; any commercially available test, and the labs doing this (NIH, CHOP) have been doing it for research purposes. At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theglia.org/2019gliaconference&quot;&gt;2019 GLIA Conference&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Vanderver fielded a question about where doctors should send these blood samples for testing and she said that you should contact either her or Dr. Goldbach-Mansky and that they were working on making it available as a clinical test. Their methods are described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/29638206/&quot;&gt;Development of a Validated Interferon Score Using NanoString Technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative for those outside of the U.S., you may be able to get support from Dr. Yanick Crow at the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues in France. His group has used a different method for measuring interferon stimulated genes, qPCR. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5325846/&quot;&gt;Assessment of Type I Interferon Signaling in Pediatric Inflammatory Disease&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s important to know that this method is different and potentially less reliable. You may not be able to compare these scores with any research being done by Dr. Goldbach-Manksy or Dr. Vanderver. However, at first glance, the upcoming clinical trial at CHOP reads as if they will be using PCR, perhaps  they have found this method to be &lt;em&gt;reliable enough&lt;/em&gt; for treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I&apos;m aware, you only have three options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurance Coverage for the Drug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to adapt the appeal letter I sent to our insurance company. Know that I had a purpose in writing this letter, to save $4-6k a month. I wouldn&apos;t defend the veracity of this letter. This drug is expensive, and the evidence for it is considered weak. You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be denied. We eventually succeeded after multiple appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Medical Reviewer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write in appeal of your company’s decision to deny my child the life saving medication baricitinib/Olumiant for her extremely rare genetic disorder, Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS). I do so on the advice provided to my doctor by a Cigna medical reviewer that submission of my appeal would not jeopardize or in any way hamper a similar second level appeal expected by our doctor. Considering the likelihood of your lack of familiarity with Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome and treatments, I request that you read my references carefully before considering our appeal. We are remarkably fortunate to have received a rapid, genetically confirmed diagnosis and access to an effective drug therapy that has already halted the progression of my child’s disease and neurological decline [1]. At this time, there do not exist alternatives to this medication that are capable of mediating this disorder’s chronically elevated interferon signaling. I’m confident that you’ll find the remarkable nature of my child’s condition and relevant research compelling enough to overturn your original decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your decision to deny my child this medication puts her at risk of death (19.3% of AGS patients die in early childhood [11]) and, should she survive, will certainly increase her medical costs many fold, destroying her quality of life in the process. Without treatment, my child may end up among the 73% of patients that are “profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function” [11]. I encourage you to take a moment and consider what that means. Had we not successfully intervened for my child with baricitinib or should we fail to continue treatment for financial reasons, she faces an overwhelming risk of ending up in a virtually vegetative state, incapable of intentional movement and communication. Even in the best of outcomes, she will be devastatingly changed. In the largest study of its kind, “only 14 of 294 patients [...] were able to walk with no/ minimal support.” [11]. She will likely suffer from among “chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus” and other serious and life threatening medical complications [11]. I find this to directly contradict your decision to deny our expedited appeal on the grounds that this “does not involve an imminent and serious threat to the health of the member.” This reflects a lack of seriousness on your part in consideration of the extreme threat that this disease poses to my child, and I find it completely unacceptable. Please read the following carefully, as I’ve gone to great pains to provide you with scientific and clinical research that supports our use of this medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013, O&apos;Shea et al. reviewed the emerging Janus Kinase inhibitors (or jakinibs), remarking on how they offered “new therapies for diverse clinical entities ranging from malignancy to autoimmunity” [12] on the basis that “an increasing body of evidence implicates specific cytokines and cell subsets as drivers of pathogenesis in different autoimmune diseases.” [12] Furthermore, “many use the Jak/STAT pathway to exert their effects, rendering them amenable to therapeutic blockade with Jakinibs.” [12] In direct and relevant fashion to my child’s neurodegenerative disease, Yan et al. in 2016 concluded that “the involvement of JAK/STAT signaling in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases suggests that inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling could provide therapeutic benefit,” [13] remarking that “pre-clinical studies have demonstrated efficacy of JAK/STAT inhibition in neuroinflammatory diseases.” [13] Just prior, in 2015, Crow and Manel painfully explained the molecular function of proteins and signalling pathways in AGS that lead “to activation of the transcription factor complex ISGF3” (which include STAT1 and STAT2) directly implicating the JAK/STAT pathway in disease pathogenesis [15]. Furthermore, Crow postulated in 2015 that after “defining a disturbance of type I interferon as relevant to the pathogenesis of a disease,” strategies of treatment “could include the use of [...] JAK inhibitors.” [14] With great foresight Crow shared his prediction “that the field is likely to develop rapidly, providing hope for the development of rational therapies for this devastating group of human diseases.” [14] The buildup to clinical trials using JAK inhibitors for treating AGS and other interferonopathies occured very quickly and within the last decade, and their use in open label clinical trials has commenced within the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I request that you seek guidance from Dr. Rafaela Goldbach-Mansky (​&lt;a href=&quot;https://irp.nih.gov/pi/raphaela-goldbach-mansky%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;https://irp.nih.gov/pi/raphaela-goldbach-mansky​&lt;/a&gt;, 1-301-761-7553), chief and principal investigator of the National Institute of Health NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) Translational Autoinflammatory Disease Studies (TADS) Unit. Dr. Goldbach-Manksy’s (and her group’s) work involve many years of clinical research using baricitinib to successfully treat patients with AGS and other “mendelian interferonopathies” [2,3,4]. Additionally, I request that you seek consultation with Dr. Yanick Crow of the MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (IGMM) at the University of Edinburgh, (​&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ed.ac.uk/centre-genomic-medicine/research-groups/crow-research-group%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;https://www.ed.ac.uk/centre-genomic-medicine/research-groups/crow-research-group​&lt;/a&gt;, +44 (0) 131 651 1041), who in assessing potential therapies for interferonopathies in the Journal of Experimental Medicine related success with a functionally equivalent agent and related Janus Kinase inhibitor (ruxolitinib), “we observed highly promising efficacy in all aspects of the clinical phenotype (systemic inflammation, destructive skin lesions, and pulmonary disease.” [5,6] Further studies by Dr. Crow in Europe have demonstrated the effectiveness of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition [7,8,9]. And finally, should you continue to find the above unconvincing, I request that you consult with Dr. Adeline Vanderver (​&lt;a href=&quot;https://vanderverlab.research.chop.edu/contact%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;https://vanderverlab.research.chop.edu/contact​&lt;/a&gt;, 1-215-590-3068), program director of the Leukodystrophy Center of Excellence, Jacob A. Kamens Endowed Chair in Neurologic Disorders and Translational Neurotherapeutics at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia, and member of the medical and scientific advisory board of the United Leukodystrophy Foundation. Dr. Vanderver’s clinical research has demonstrated baricitinib to impart a “significant decrease in interferon scores and improvement in clinical scores” [10] in AGS patients and her team has concluded that baricitinib “may be an effective approach in AGS to decrease interferon signaling” [10]. Dr. Vanderver and the Leukodystrophy Center of Excellence continue to treat patients with baricitinib that were enrolled in their compassionate use trial. Their expanded/compassionate use clinical research trial, was forced to stop enrolling when baricitinib became FDA approved, but they are actively planning and pursuing a follow-up with Eli Lilly and the FDA. In communication with our team in North Carolina, she communicated her belief that baricitinib “blocks the IFN mediated end organ damage” and shows promise in children with AGS. Unsurprisingly, after evaluating my child in Philadelphia on 3/7/2019, Dr. Vanderver deduced that baricitinib likely interrupted the disease process that began at the beginning of 2019, bestowing a remarkable benefit to my child in the context of such a devastating disorder. I assure you that there are no greater experts of AGS and interferonopathies (a term first coined by Dr. Crow [16]) than these three doctors and principal investigators. I’ve been in contact with all three seeking advice in my efforts to save my child, and it’s revealing that all three have been involved in developing the theory for and in driving clinical research trials with JAK inhibitors for AGS patients. Their conclusions and publications should weigh strongly in favor of my appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, given the context of this or any other extremely rare disease, the burden of evidence for approving treatment must be considered from a unique perspective. It would be cruel and inhumane to expect a randomized, placebo controlled study to assess the efficacy of treatment for a ruinous disease of which only 374 cases were known to have occurred as of 2015 [11]. Both the rarity and morbidity of AGS make it difficult to assemble a suitable population for study. Consider Hoffman et al., describing Dr. Goldbach-Mansky’s work with baricitinib, “it should be noted that a similar comprehensive protocol was the basis for FDA licensing and orphan disease approval of anakinra for neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), without the traditional large-scale, placebo-controlled study typical of pivotal clinical trials.” [17] Hoffman unambiguously commends Dr. Goldbach-Mansky for her work stating that it “further [establishes] this patient-focused approach as the definitive method for therapeutic intervention in rare diseases.” [17] The rarity of this disease must be considered in regards to our appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astoundingly and despite the rarity of this disease, this life-saving and life-sustaining medication has been effectively demonstrated in a substantial and compelling proportion of the affected AGS population and remains a promising and effective therapy in ongoing clinical research [3,6,7,8,9,10]. The genetic and biomolecular causes of the AGS disease pathology are well understood [5,15,16] and have very recently led to this opportunity presented to my child. I implore you to recognize the strength of the evidence and costs and consequences (personal, financial, and otherwise) of not approving my appeal. There is simply no alternative treatment, and my child’s life balances on your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Patrick Winters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frantic Research - January 24th - January 25th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t sleep the night that we received Auri&apos;s diagnosis, not because I was sad or nervous but because I couldn&apos;t stop researching. I began reading everything I could about AGS, and a particular name kept popping up. Yanick Crow seemed to be an author on every important paper. He had penned a comprehensive overview of the disease in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and even coined the term &quot;interferonopathies&quot; to describe a category of diseases with a similar pathology. He was leading one of the two clinical trials using reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs - HIV drugs) and had theorized quite a bit over the last ten years about potential therapies. The next morning, I found his e-mail address and wrote him. A portion follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m reaching out in hopes of learning about early indications of efficacy within your RTI trial for AGS patients. We need to develop a plan of therapy (or understand the necessity of a trial) as soon as possible in the hopes of arresting or reducing [Auri&apos;s] neurological decline. I understand that these trials likely monitor interferon alpha levels in patients &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; their acute neurologic episode, but with very little in the literature about other scenarios we&apos;re looking to understand and try anything of use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he replied quickly and provided me with the clinical research he had been involved in with JAK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We and others are trying to work out if the drugs that are currently available make a difference at the neurological level (I attach the papers that we have published on JAK inhibition), but I have to admit that it is not completely straightforward to know that (it is one thing to see an effect at, say, the level of the skin, another matter in regards to the brain).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already read a ton the night before and had some context for his conservative reply. At least a handful of papers had discussed the theory behind JAK inhibition, and it seemed like it had been guessed that it could be a promising therapy for AGS. I blew past his warnings, thrilled at least that I had received a response and been on to something. Encouragingly, I also had success contacting CHOP on Friday and began the process of authorizing medical record release and signing up for their research studies. I started to feel some relief that we not only knew what we were dealing with, but there seemed to be experts and options. Surely we&apos;d find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Contacts - January 25th - January 29th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 25th, after speaking with CHOP&apos;s research coordinator, I put together a bunch  of pictures and videos of Auri. I had hoped to demonstrate to them how early we had intervened in Auri&apos;s disease, so that they might register the importance of acting quickly. I shared videos of her eating, playing, and standing. It felt like we were getting connected to the team that we needed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 27th, our neurologist received word from CHOP that made me simultaneously hopeful and frustrated. It seemed to confirm that JAK inhibition, which had been tried with success by Dr. Crow, had been working in their clinical trial. Unfortunately, their clinical trial was closed. The principal investigator wrote as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect to re-open our trial of baricitib soon, though we are not enrolling yet. It is a janus kinase inhibitor, and we think blocks the IFN mediated end organ damage. We see moderate success, in particular for these kids with later onset.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following days, I scheduled a clinical visit with CHOP for February 21st and set up to have blood samples sent to them for testing the activity of &quot;interferon stimulated genes.&quot; The scores computed from these samples would confirm whether Auri had this disease and possibly tell us something about its severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to Figure Out What to Do - January 29th - February 4th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some confusion about the state of things, and I spoke with a college friend of mine, an M.D. that works in the University fo Colorado hospital. He assured me that since baricitinib had been approved by the FDA for an indication, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be prescribed for any other reason. It was just a matter of finding a doctor that would prescribe &quot;off-label.&quot; It became clear that CHOP either could not or would not participate. A nurse practitioner described the situation to me over the phone as a Catch-22, and assured me that they would be restarting their clinical trial (&lt;em&gt;side-note: it&apos;s May 2nd as I write and they still haven&apos;t opened another trial&lt;/em&gt;). I have more empathy now for the awkwardness of the situation; they&apos;re working diligently to collect data in &lt;em&gt;controlled&lt;/em&gt; experiments to undeniably demonstrate this therapies safety and efficacy for helping &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;. This is no light matter, and we&apos;re taking risks not knowing what the long term effects of this will be. Nonetheless, on February 3rd, I replied to an e-mail from CHOP&apos;s research coordinator asking about whether we were able to send blood samples. I was really upset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I received your message, but I&apos;m contemplating next steps. I was hopeful that your organization would be willing to either treat or guide treatment for Aurelia much sooner. February 21st represents an unacceptable delay to me and further loss of my daughter&apos;s QOL. Without any guarantees from CHOP, I&apos;m hoping to pursue anti-JAK therapy at Duke. With any luck, we&apos;ll be discussing options this week with our team here. Assuming they take the lead, I&apos;m certain they&apos;ll want to measure interferon levels. I don&apos;t want to submit Auri to any redundant or unnecessary blood draws.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with all of this happening in the background, our neurologist replied to me after what felt like an eternity to assure me that she wanted to treat Auri:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m in agreement with your sense of timing needing to move quickly. I am going to get pieces in place for JAK meds if we need to do them here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looked difficult, though. The drug hasn&apos;t been studied well for this use, and barely at all in children. What&apos;s more, Auri&apos;s situation was unique. My research had confirmed what our neurologist described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In general- the treated people I can find have not been in a clinical situation similar to Auri, so we are in very very uncharted waters here as far as effects of treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell, there hadn&apos;t been a single child with AGS that had undergone this treatment at this stage of the disease. It was simply unknown whether it could halt the neurological damage, and everyone I spoke with offered caution about jumping to conclusions. (I later found out that this was not entirely true, but the children that have had interventions with JAK inhibitors could still be counted on one hand.) Still, the rationale in research seemed strong; and it didn&apos;t seem surprising that it hadn&apos;t been tried like this yet with such a rare disease. Auri had been diagnosed remarkably quickly. I couldn&apos;t understand why everyone wasn&apos;t jumping at the opportunity to help her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Out of Options - February 5th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dejected - Morning February 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a morning phone call with our neurologist on February 5th that destroyed my hopes for treatment at Duke.  I took this call in a small conference room at my office. I sat at a desk and took notes while we spoke. The team at Duke simply didn&apos;t have enough experience, evidence, or research to make this happen. And, CHOP wouldn&apos;t assist; they had a responsibility to establish evidence of this therapy working in AGS before participating in treatment of children outside of their study. However, if they thought through their research that it was working and knew that they couldn&apos;t re-open their clinical trial in time, I couldn&apos;t understand why they would not help. Our doctor didn&apos;t have the answers, and she seemed disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t know what to say. If there was nothing we could do, we were back where we started, hopeless. I had been grieving for weeks, assuming that I was going to lose my daughter. The diagnosis and my research had let me begin to believe that there was a solution and that we could save her. As it turned out, there was more experience with and evidence for the promise of this therapy than I had known. I felt so low, but I had to finish the remainder of the day at work. In what reflects the seriousness of the situation, our doctor had suggested to me a few weeks prior that I focus on enjoying what time remained with Auri. Until this point I had been unable to slow or calm down. Ending the phone call, I remember assuring her that I would do so now. Paraphrasing, my response to her &quot;we can&apos;t save your daughter&quot; was &quot;then it&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m spending quality time with her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I Might as Well Try - February 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like every door had closed, but their was still one loose thread. Dr. Rafaela Goldbach-Manksy and her group at the NIH had originally established the treatment and monitoring protocol that was being used by CHOP. I didn&apos;t know enough about her group&apos;s work at the time, but I was aware that my doctor had attempted and failed to make contact with her. I thought that I might as well try to reach out. Maybe I could still make something happen. I called. She didn&apos;t answer. I left a voicemail. I recently wrote her a thank you, and I&apos;ll just let it tell how I had felt in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;... returning my phone call, gave me renewed hope on the very day that I had lost it. I had just navigated an entire month of grief, panic, and fear that included a humbling acknowledgement of a problem in my previously healthy child, a terrifying suggestion of a likely fatal leukodystrophy, panic that my other children might meet the same fate, the paradoxical relief and devastation of a rapid genetic diagnosis of a de-novo mutation for AGS, the hope of promising clinical trials, and finally the somber disillusionment that said treatment would be inaccessible to Auri when she needed it. Throughout most of January, I sat helpless while my daughter turned to sand and began slipping faster and faster through my fingers. As soon as I received Auri’s genetic report, I got to work on research. As a graduate student of computer science, I worked for Richard Bonneau at NYU’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. I felt uncommonly prepared to ensure that my daughter had the best options. I read so much. I took notes. I contacted PI’s. Within a few days, I became convinced that JAK blockade represented an astounding and perhaps unprecedented opportunity for Auri. Unfortunately, I quickly found myself helpless again. Our neurologist shared my eagerness to treat Auri promptly but was unable to garner the necessary support, neither in nor outside of Duke. We would have to wait until CHOP began enrolling in a follow-up trial. Auri’s doctor and I had a difficult conversation that ended with something to the effect of “good luck,” knowing full well that Auri faced an overwhelming likelihood of neurological devastation. That same afternoon after work, waiting in line to pick up my son from kindergarten and after having cried the entire drive, I decided to try calling you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought Max home and went through the motions with the kids: dinner, shower, book, bed. I couldn&apos;t believe that all of my efforts were going to come up short. I felt like I had worked so hard. At this point, I was in tears most nights in bed; and this evening was particularly rough. Lights off, trying to sleep, my phone buzzed. I received a text message from an unknown number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you for your message. We do not have a protocol for AGS but please send me your e-mail and I will send you our dosing data. The neurologists in North Carolina should be able to prescribe baricitinib as it is approved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;HOLY FUCK!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; I shouted. I can&apos;t remember what I did after that, but it wasn&apos;t sleep. I&apos;m certain I replied, carefully, acknowledging where things stood and what I was trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Regression - February 5th - 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we waited, I kept researching. As much as I was capable, I tried to build an understanding of the disease and it&apos;s mechanics. I kept telling Natalie that I could understand what I was reading, but it was really hard to connect papers because I had no background knowledge. I had no recall, and simply couldn&apos;t remember details about what I had read the day before. I was trying to pull something together with little to no relevant education. It was incredibly frustrating. While I was doing this, Auri got sick again and this time it seemed much worse. Based on what we understood about her disease, it was possible that she could be less severely affected and stop worsening. What we witnessed this week seemed to make it clear that Auri&apos;s decline continued, and she was running out of skills to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events of the week had me in a panic. Auri had been sick, likely worsening her disease; and she wasn&apos;t sleeping. Natalie had spent every night of the week on cushions on the floor of Auri&apos;s room. She was waking, crying every hour, if she was even able to fall back asleep. I had joined an AGS family support group on Facebook, and, if I remember correctly, somebody had asked this week about how others help their kids sleep. Parent after parent shared that their kids awoke multiple times at night during the best of times, some because they were unable to shift themselves or roll over. Seeing what could happen and reading about others&apos; outcomes, I was a wreck. Auri was becoming &quot;floppy,&quot; an actual medical term describing a lack of muscle tone. We would pick her up and she felt like a sack of potatoes, with absolutely no strength in her back to sit up in our arms and look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I had called Dr. Fatemi&apos;s office at the Kennedy Krieger Institute hoping for other options. I believe, at the time, that he was the chairman of the United Leukodystrophy Foundation. Through a surrogate, he replied that his organization (and most others) refer AGS patients to CHOP due to their experience with anti-JAK therapy. Another door that I knocked on failed to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Frantic Plea for Help - Evening of February 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Friday evening rolled around, I checked out of the family routine. I decided that I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to do something and got started immediately after work. I sat on the couch downstairs, while everyone else ate dinner and did bedtime, and began to make a list of people to contact. I started with every member of the United Leukodystrophy Foundation&apos;s medical advisory board, and began including authors from anti-JAK research papers that I thought could be relevant. Dr. G had told me that she was aware that some patients had achieved private insurance approval/coverage of the drug, and that made me think some of the doctors involved might be using this drug outside of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lot of e-mails that night, trying to stay professional but understanding that this was really a last ditch effort. I had also been asking parents in the support group whether any of them had any other ideas or people to contact. During the week I had contacted a doctor from a different children&apos;s hospital based on their advice, and this evening I received another name that I reached out to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I knew that this drug therapy was complex and required careful and constant monitoring. I would have been willing to do just about anything (I had in fact told Dr. Crow I would fly to the U.K. in a heartbeat if it were an option), but I recognized how important it was to make this happen locally. I wrote a few e-mails pleading for help and demanding a direct rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To our neurologist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My sweet, joyful, smart, expressive, and clever little girl is dying. We will love however much of her body and mind remains, but we will have lost our daughter that we take so much pride in. I recognize that Auri&apos;s in need of a courageous doctor, I&apos;m asking you to be that person. For my daughter&apos;s sake, I can&apos;t stop trying; her salvation lies within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the chair of pediatrics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This questionable time frame [for restarting clinical trials] represents severe CNS organ damage for my child and severe physical and intellectual disability. By our account, she&apos;s cognitively on par with her peers right now. Without guarantees [...] and a time frame that has changed in the past, I&apos;m not willing to take this risk. Waiting is tantamount to abstaining from treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Aurelia has no acceptable options and continues to worsen. We&apos;re willing to do whatever possible and pay whatever it costs out of pocket to make this happen at Duke. The risks of not treating her far outweigh the risks inherent to anti-JAK therapy. I&apos;m guaranteed to lose my daughter in mind if not body. Can you help us make something happen?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Dr. K:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&apos;t spoken to her in a little over two weeks, when she had wished us luck after hearing that some preliminary genetic results were communicated to our doctor over the phone. I knew that her specialty wasn&apos;t really relevant to this, but I hoped that she might be able to advocate for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was hoping to appeal to your experience for some logistical and advocacy advice. I&apos;m sorry for the lengthy e-mail but I think context is important (it&apos;s rather rich now after two weeks). I&apos;ve poured myself into AGS research and made contact with a few of the right people. I feel like Auri is up against a logistical problem, not a medical one; and I&apos;m wondering if there&apos;s any advice or assistance you could provide. An effective therapy exists, but it&apos;s complicated, off-label, and we somehow need to motivate and inspire a handful of doctors at the same time to try something new. I really don&apos;t know how to present the context or what questions to ask you. Frankly, I&apos;m frustrated because this therapy could arrest Auri&apos;s CNS damage, but we have not secured any guarantee of treatment. I believe [our neurologist] is willing and eager but requires support from pediatric rheumatology at Duke. Do you have any ideas or influence that could make an IND or treatment at Duke happen quickly? Is this not the right thing to do; am I asking too much of everyone? Is an IND necessary given that we&apos;re willing and able to pay out of pocket?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] Thanks to WES, we have a rapid and early diagnosis for Auri, but I can&apos;t seem to secure her treatment. We&apos;re looking at a wait of many months with CHOP which could have profound consequences on her intellect and health. She stands to save so much if we could start now, and she continues to deteriorate. There&apos;s more genetic, biomolecular, and clinical AGS research than what I&apos;ve provided. [...] I have so much more to stay about this, but my research and efforts seem to hit a brick wall and I don&apos;t have a ladder. Would you be able to help me build one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She replied within twenty minutes, &quot;I’m in meetings until tonight.  I will study this and send back a reply later tonight or tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Fucking Miracle - February 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nine in the morning on Saturday, February 9th, Dr. K had replied; and I&apos;m certain that reading this brought me to tears. It still does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Patrick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see no reason why one of these two anti JAK drugs couldn’t be tried.  I also think that Auri is going to need aggressive supportive care.  That will include a gastrostomy tube for feeding, hydration and medications, and possibly other interventions. You and her mom will also need to fully understand the side effects of these drugs so that you are not surprised if some of them occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot make this happen over the weekend, but I can ‘talk’ with the parties involved to figure out if we can make this happen at Duke or if we need to refer her to another institution to get the therapy.  I completely understand that Duke would be preferred and I will do whatever I can to make it happen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back in touch on and off over the weekend with updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just another moment in a serious of traumatic highs and lows that brought me to the edge of insanity over and over again. I&apos;ve wondered lately how I managed to keep from snapping, having placed so much pressure on myself. From my perspective, I was trying desperately to save my daughter&apos;s life from a couch with a computer. Natalie and I went to dinner with my Aunt that was visiting to help us. We managed to smile and make small talk, but only Maureen would remember how much we were really present. I think I was somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logistics - February 10th - 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few important things happened on Sunday. It was clear that Auri&apos;s situation had escalated over the weekend. The chair of pediatrics at Duke replied to me that she was personally reaching out to Dr. G, whom she had worked with in the past. She assured me, &quot;please know we do understand the urgency to get her the right care.&quot; I didn&apos;t understand the gravity of her involvement and &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; kept pushing. Natalie&apos;s sister pointed out how significant this development was, and even Dr. G expressed the same sentiment. I kept my mouth shut and simply said thank you. I was in a &lt;em&gt;panic&lt;/em&gt; at the dinner table, wondering what was happening and whether this was going to be a breakthrough. I didn&apos;t eat. I just paced in the dining room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening on Sunday, I also heard from another doctor elsewhere about the possibility of doing anti-JAK therapy. This felt like a backup plan, but I started signing authorization forms to send medical records and began a back and forth e-mail chain that kept me up until midnight. By the end of the weekend, we had arranged a clinic visit with Dr. K on Tuesday and were developing a promising lead. Monday was calm. I think I went to work, watched the clock, and hoped we would receive good news on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Success - February 12th&lt;/h3&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we got the green light and Dr. K was going to manage treatment. It took a minute for the news to come out, and we went into the appointment not sure of the decisions made over the weekend. Before getting the news, I expressed to Dr. K how grateful I was that she took up the cause and how &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; I felt in all of this. I had done whatever I felt I could, but continually reckoned with how little control I had over the outcome. I think she might have thought I already knew their decision, because I had to ask for clarification (&quot;does this mean you &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; going to do this?&quot;). When she said yes I put my head in my hands and broke down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; difficult time recalling pivotal moments like these without losing it. My daughter&apos;s future seemed to balance on so much outside of my control, but I wouldn&apos;t have been able to live with myself if I had failed. At some point in the previous week, Natalie had told me that she was proud of all the research and work I had performed. I appreciated her saying so, but I told her that none of it mattered unless we succeeded. While there were a few moments of uncertainty in the following days, there was nothing that put access to this treatment at risk. We had succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lennox's Birthday and Some Videos of Auri's Movement and Play]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Roller Coaster Ending With Improved Lab Tests It's been a stressful few weeks.

&lt;h3&gt;A Roller Coaster Ending With Improved Lab Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a stressful few weeks. On my birthday, April 9th, Auri had some disappointing lab results. Some of her white blood cell counts dropped significantly and her EBV viral count went up an order of magnitude. Her doctor assured us that there wasn&apos;t anything necessarily abnormal about what we were seeing. Auri had tested positive (at very low levels) for EBV in February, and she might still be working through it because the values weren&apos;t that high. Additionally, her cell counts were potentially related and she expected them to recover. Over the last few weeks, she hasn&apos;t been sleeping well and we expect another tooth. The tooth has yet to come but we can see the slit. And, she&apos;s been running a fever for the last couple of days, which adds to the stress. Last night was particularly miserable, but she&apos;s been happy during the day. When she cut her bottom teeth, we saw something similar. We just have our fingers crossed that we&apos;ll see a tooth soon and have a better few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piling on, on April 17th, our dog had &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; surgery to remove a large tumor. He&apos;s doing better now, but when I brought him home I panicked thinking I had made the wrong decision. He&apos;s been suffering knee trouble again and had a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult time getting up for a day or two. Now on his feet again, he seems pretty happy and relatively normal. But, he has a &lt;em&gt;gruesome&lt;/em&gt; wound with twenty staples. For a few days I had to empty fluid draining from the cavity left by the removed tumor. I really wish that we didn&apos;t have to deal with this too, but I think we&apos;re past the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this past week we saw Auri&apos;s white blood cell counts recover and her EBV count go back to where it was before she started treatment. Additionally, we have another result showing &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; improvements in Auri&apos;s interferon scores. These scores indicate the activity of &quot;interferon stimulated genes,&quot; which are used to measure disease activity in AGS, CANDLE, and SAVI (among others) in a research setting. The numbers for AGS patients, I&apos;ve been told, can range between 50 and 500 during active disease; but I can&apos;t find the data to back it up. In what&apos;s published, it seems like there&apos;s &quot;a trend to higher levels in IFIH1,&quot; Auri&apos;s genotype. It&apos;s clear that her scores when we started treatment were &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; and indicated active disease. I hope that these reductions continue and that we see more stability to go with it. I think the most recent value puts Auri pretty close to normal and within the baseline they see in stable children with AGS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentary: I think the &quot;AGS Pre-Treatment&quot; values seem low because the disease has this &quot;once and done&quot; kind of behavior. The samples would be from children that have already experienced their active and acute disease phase. In contrast, CANDLE and SAVI are chronic diseases that never let up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our bi-weekly followup with Auri&apos;s doctor this past Tuesday, we were asked some questions that made me realize how difficult it is for the doctor to gauge Auri&apos;s progress through pictures or short visits. I believe Dr. K. asked if Auri was capable of taking toys out of a box. Natalie and I were probably surprised that the question would be asked, but Auri does spend most of the office visit sitting in our lap and yelling. So, I asked if it would be helpful to share some videos. I sent her an e-mail (below) with a few videos from the past two weeks. And, I have one additional video to share from this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 25th - In Her New Jumper - &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ryssLUsW11rYCLid8&quot;&gt;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ryssLUsW11rYCLid8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I have a lot of these little videos documenting Auri&apos;s progress. I should have offered confirmation today; yes, she&apos;s been improving, slowly. My anxiety has been about whether she can maintain this treatment, not about whether it has been working. I don&apos;t think she&apos;ll check any boxes for regained skills soon, but her strength has improved and she&apos;s headed in a positive direction. If we could bill insurance for all the hard work Natalie makes her perform, we&apos;d be millionaires. Auri is always moving, always working. Here are a few videos that answer some of your questions today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lennox&apos;s Birthday Party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had a small birthday party for Lennox. We invited just a couple of his friends over and played in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, we&apos;ve established the expectation that we&apos;ll have a Piñata. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/BwCqyjHeM25Gpbi29&quot;&gt;The kids love to beat the hell out of it&lt;/a&gt;, but they can never get it open themselves because we won&apos;t give them a metal rod. It felt nice (and normal) to have a little party. We&apos;ve been terribly stressed this month, and watching everyone have a good time helped dull the edge a little. We can&apos;t stop feeling stressed, but I feel like I can start to see normal on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dark Hallways - January 7th - January 8th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stumbled through the hospital trying to make it back to Natalie and Auri, I had to stop and compose myself multiple times. I kept fearing I was going to faint, and my knees were so weak that I kind of awkwardly fell through the hallways. On the verge of a breakdown, I spotted Natalie&apos;s sister in front of me and barely choked out her name. A somber hug and an almost run to the hospital room brought me to them unbearably slowly. Natalie sat on the bed, trying to keep Auri calm. It just didn&apos;t look much different than earlier that day, except that they were both exhausted. Auri had to be sedated for her MRI, and she had been poked and prodded and was not making anything easy. As tired as she might have been, both Natale and I knew that she wasn&apos;t going to sleep well that night. I had to say goodbye knowing that Natalie had the worst of it and wouldn&apos;t get any rest. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t remember much about that night. I can&apos;t remember how I got home or what I did when I got there. All I&apos;m certain of is that I took a few Tylenol PM because I did so every night for the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a restless night at home and the emotional difficulty of delivering Max and Lennox to school the next day, I found myself struggling through the halls of the hospital again. When I reached Auri&apos;s room, I found that she and Natalie had been taken to prep for a lumbar puncture to draw cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for testing. Two nurses offered to walk me to them, but I really needed a few more to carry me. I had to stop foor multiple panic attacks before finding Natalie in the procedure room, with Auri on a table about to get a needle in her spine. This was the last of tests before we demanded to leave. They&apos;d have what they needed to try and figure it out. We just wanted to go home. If I had no energy, I can&apos;t imagine how Natalie felt after two days in a hospital with an infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discharge - January 8th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On what I believe was the same day, Auri&apos;s neurologist spoke with us before discharge and read us that the MRI indicated &quot;abnormal white matter changes concerning for leukodystrophy of unknown etiology.&quot; In what was my first brush with seemingly paradoxical statements about Auri&apos;s health, she told us that it was a good catch by the resident radiologist because the abnormalities were subtle and hard to spot. It meant that we caught it early. Something about how that was phrased seemed absurd to me, but I still had at least one foot out the door and a toe dipped in denial. How could I accept what I was being told? I couldn&apos;t really process what was happening, and everything I was hearing was terrifying. As Natalie got Auri ready to leave, I spoke with the ER residents and attending about discharge instructions. It was another moment in a month of absurdities. As I sat in a chair in the hallway, they asked me if I understood what was happening and what our next steps were. I calmly explained that I understood that my daughter was dying, and that we were to keep her comfortable and enjoy whatever time with her that we had left. I can remember the pain in their faces and their uncertainty about how to end the conversation. As far as they knew, that was exactly what was happening. At least one looked like she wanted to give me a hug but she must have thought twice about it because they left with that sort of awkward, backward shuffle that people do when they want to get away from a difficult situation. One doctor lingered, but I felt so far from reality. I didn&apos;t want her sympathy. I left in a blur to pick up Max from school, relieved that Natalie was on my heels with Auri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maybe It&apos;s Nothing - January 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I kept telling myself. Everyone I spoke with tried to remind me to remain positive and hopeful. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I lied to myself. The day after we left the hospital, we actually took everyone to Dave and Buster&apos;s. I had been taking the boys there somewhat regularly as a treat for good behavior. Natalie and I wanted to do something as a family, and since Auri had never been, we thought it might be the perfect activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the insanity of the previous few days, we found relief and had a lot of fun. I thought that if we could do stuff like this together, it might not be so bad. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I thought again. Or, if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; something, maybe it would turn out alright. If I allowed myself to think this was real, I had to acknowledge that either Max or Lennox stood a large chance of having the same thing happen to them. Most leukodystrophies are genetically recessive, and the math worked out to a 44% chance that one of them might have inherited the same thing. I couldn&apos;t face that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Definitely Looks like Something - January 10th - January 15th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Eye Test - January 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were referred to follow up with a neuro-ophthalmologist to determine if Auri had any damage to her optic nerve that might help with a differential diagnosis. With a clap and a proclamation of &quot;good news&quot; she told us that Auri&apos;s optic nerve looked fine. It was &lt;em&gt;good news&lt;/em&gt; because damage might have been a sign of &quot;one of the bad ones,&quot; she was referring to leukodystrophies. That struck me in such an awkwardly painful way that I stared to tear up. &quot;Is there a good leukodystrophy?&quot; I wondered. &quot;Are you okay, sir?&quot; she asked and actually handed me a lollipop. &quot;Am I okay?&quot; It was such a strange thought to think that there was good news, or that she had just given me some. It was what I came to understand (and later describe) as a relativism that continued and grew stranger with every appointment. However, the lollipop did make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the waiting room, Auri was &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/bWVydTzLdPVCQdFc6&quot;&gt;eating a banana&lt;/a&gt; and playing with toys. She was sitting up in Natalie&apos;s lap. I couldn&apos;t make sense of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reaching Out - January 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, on Friday, January 11th, I sent an e-mail to Dr. K about her &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02254863&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; introducing umbilical cord blood as an advance and adjunctive therapy to bone marrow transplantation. I had hoped that we could get Auri prepared for whatever might be necessary by finding the right contact. A portion of what I wrote her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we receive confirmation that Auri is experiencing the onset of a late infantile leukodystrophy, I would like to be in a position to offer her options. I&apos;m sure you know that the rate of progression of these diseases in infants can make HSCT inadvisable, and I&apos;m hopeful that your trial may provide an avenue for treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Dr. K - January 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, Dr K. replied over the weekend and asked to take a look at Auri&apos;s case. By the end of Saturday, she had scheduled us to meet in clinic the following week. On Tuesday, the 15th, we drew some blood samples to do HLA typing (to find a donor match). From what I remember as an afterthought, she suggested we order Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). The results of some of the blood and spinal fluid tests had already ruled out some of the more common leukodystrophies, and Dr. K. said something to the effect of &quot;whatever this is, WES will tell us faster than anything else.&quot; She and her team were to see about getting it rushed. This meeting and that decision proved to be &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to our story. At the time, I worried that Dr. K wouldn&apos;t be able to help us. I asked her what would exclude Auri from bone marrow transplantation as a treatment. She told me that it can take up to six months before it has an effect, and that further regression and increased spasticity would rule it out. My understanding of how fast leukodystrophies progress meant that even if the treatment proved to be an option, Auri might not survive long enough or be in a good enough condition to make it advisable. With tremendous difficulty, I asked her point blank if she thought this was a leukodystrophy. She didn&apos;t mince words. In her opinion and experience, it &lt;em&gt;looked classically so&lt;/em&gt;. Confusingly, the nurses and aides in the room kept remarking to each other how remarkable it was that Auri still had &quot;so much function.&quot; They seemed genuinely surprised to see a child with what appeared to be such an early and rapid diagnosis. This gave me some hope, but it also made me begin to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s Actually Going On? - January 16th - January 24th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, we were over a week into this tragedy and the stress had already taken its toll. I don&apos;t remember eating anything but a handful of crackers and a lollipop after checking Auri into the hospital. I weighed myself, and I had lost over ten pounds. When I shared this with Natalie, she had lost the same. Between us, we weren&apos;t sleeping or eating; and I hadn&apos;t shown up for work in over a week. I wish I could say that this was my lowest point in this story, but it continued to get worse. We still tried to maintain composure and do things like meet Max at his elementary school for lunch and go to the park or kid&apos;s museum.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 20th, Auri was clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/1b6H3dnPpzMUzDAh6&quot;&gt;struggling to crawl&lt;/a&gt;, but the changes still seemed slow. I don&apos;t have a picture or video of it, but Natalie remembers January 23rd as the last day she was able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-Up with Neurology - January 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after entering the hospital, we had a follow up with our neurologist that gave us more questions than answers. The comprehensive set of CSF and blood tests were inconclusive. Mostly, they ruled things out. It was unclear what to try next. So, if I remember correctly, the doctor said that we were going to go &quot;old school,&quot; and tests for things, however unlikely, that might be immediately treatable. This included checking for (among others) vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal poisoning, and thyroid problems. To me, it seemed like Auri might have avoided the really terrible diseases; and I hoped that there was a simpler explanation. I &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; remember examining the concentration of zinc in her diaper rash cream and researching the levels need to induce toxicity. What an outrageously naive thing to think, but we had no idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Research and Attempts to Contact Help - January 18th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I began contacting others. I had a particular fear of Vanishing White Matter disease, and I tried writing a handful of clinical researchers to get advice. Even though I wasn&apos;t getting any responses, I didn&apos;t really have any other idea what to do. I was grasping at straws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My investigations have demonstrated that you&apos;re at the forefront of research into white matter disorders, in particular the role of astrocyte dysfunction in vanishing white matter disease. I&apos;m writing you in request of information about possible experiments into glial stem cell therapies or any other potential treatments for this disease. I&apos;m under the impression that experiments are only being done on mouse models right now, but I was hoping that you may know better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I was at least practicing my communication skills. I had written so many e-mails about Auri&apos;s condition that I had a template that read like a medical summary. In the weeks to come, I think that practice helped me to demonstrate, when it counted, that I had a reasonable grasp on what I was asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It Wasn&apos;t Adding Up - January 18th - 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something didn&apos;t quite add up for me at this point. I had read about leukodystrophies, and so many of them moved terrifyingly quickly. While Auri had lost skills and was struggling, she was still &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of hanging on to things. On January 20th, she was still crawling a little and getting into a kneeling position to play.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a leukodystrophy, this didn&apos;t seem to add up. I began to wonder if there was something else going wrong. It was still possible that something fixable was occurring. Auri was still trying to do so much. We tried to spend time together as a family, and we had some visitors. I kept reading about leukodystrophies and sent a number of questions to our neurologist. In one e-mail on January 22nd, I &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; hit on the idea that the brain damage we were witnessing was secondary to some other process. In a roundabout way, it turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Could inflammation markers (sedimentation rate and vWF antigen) indicate inflammation in the MRI as a secondary effect of some metabolic disorder rather than a primarily demyelinating disease? I&apos;ve been trying my hardest to research and follow along, and I&apos;m curious if you think it could be helpful to consult with any other specialists. I&apos;m under the impression that Auri&apos;s case may be unfolding in a unique way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WES Report - January 24th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary genetic report was made available to our neurologist relatively soon after we sent for it. It had taken less than two weeks from our appointment with Dr. K. I knew when the results were available because I had been in contact with the laboratory, but when I tried to get information from our doctor, she requested that we meet her the following day. Obviously, I couldn&apos;t sleep that night. I was &lt;em&gt;pissed&lt;/em&gt; then and now that we were made to wait, but I think our doctor needed the time to do research. Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is rare, and I can&apos;t imagine she felt comfortable discussing it with us without having time to figure out what it meant and what our options were. When we finally did meet, it was clear that there really weren&apos;t any. But I was handed a few research articles that I devoured on the way home that gave me some hope. There was at least one clinical trial that had been run for a few years, and researchers had speculated in the past about treatments and favorable outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Observations about the natural history of AGS] are important because they suggest that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treatment in the early stages of the disease might result in attenuation of the associated inflammation and consequent tissue damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might be possible to discontinue treatments after the subacute encephalopathic period subsides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898548/&quot;&gt;&quot;Therapies in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Y J Crow, A Vanderver, S Orcesi, T W Kuijpers, and G I Rice. 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we were made aware of a clinical research trial in Philadelphia that had just closed. We planned to contact the Children&apos;s Hospital there (CHOP) as soon as possible and see if they could provide any recommendations or assistance. We were to meet back with our neurologist in no longer than two weeks to build a plan and discuss what she could dig up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was devastated. There&apos;s no pretending otherwise. But, I had &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to direct my energy towards. I had been given a name of what I knew only as fear. It was a relief in some ways, another paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I remember that I didn&apos;t add in the first pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Pizoli said that we were looking at a &quot;formidable foe&quot; when she reviewed the MRI with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched all five Jim Gaffigan specials, one each night. I remember being really grateful to find something that helped me relax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad and mother-in-law came to visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day we went somewhere with the kids to meet their cousins. I put on Lady Gaga in the car thinking it would lift our sprits. Imagine hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ll04Zzw5UM&quot;&gt;Joanne&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve never held Natalie&apos;s hand so tightly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mostly Normal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t recall when it started, but Natalie and I have had concerns about Auri for a long time. I think we always felt sensitive about how differently she developed from her brothers. If Max and Lennox had learned something early, Auri had learned it a month or two later. She always gained skills just in time, before it seemed prudent to have concerns. If we brought it up, somebody would remind us that &quot;girls are just different.&quot; They might have been right. We&apos;ll never know. It&apos;s unclear whether she experienced disease related issues at an early age, and if she had, they weren&apos;t severe enough to notice. However, Natalie had directly voiced concerns about Auri&apos;s developmental to a friend as early as October. If none of this ever happened, we would probably just be telling people, &quot;every kid is different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Up - November 13th - December 22nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, something felt different around her first birthday. Auri had been pulling up, but not really scooting. She stood on one of her ankles funny, and Natalie and I discussed bringing it up at her one year checkup with the pediatrician. Coincidentally, at that appointment in the middle of November our doctor shared that she scored low on a parent questionnaire about her gross motor development. In fact, she &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; it. It was concerning, but we were assured that it happens sometimes. Given that everything else seemed to be continuing alright, we left hoping that it might be a fluke. We had given voice to our concerns, at least; and the pediatrician assured us that she sees more false positives than genuine issues with these questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, tensions seemed to be really high in our marriage. In retrospect,  I think we were registering that something wasn&apos;t going well. At the time, I felt like Natalie and I weren&apos;t on the same page. Auri was constantly complaining to be picked up, and we must have had a hundred arguments about training her to be more independent. After a year of doing everything for a baby, I know that we were both hoping that things would get easier. Auri could and would crawl to play by herself,  but I think that she started demanding more of us. We didn&apos;t realize that she was beginning to struggle. Though she was crawling and sitting up on her knees, I can&apos;t remember seeing her sit up on her butt. On her first birthday, though, she was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more stress to this period, I was in the process of switching jobs. Throughout the summer and fall, I had been working through a great deal of frustration with my employer. I had been given too much responsibility, too few resources, and high expectations. When I successfully delivered despite these difficulties, I didn&apos;t receive any recognition. I resolved to leave in October, and started my new position just before Thanksgiving. All of this, and my prior over-focus on work, added fuel to the fire. Natalie, on the other hand, was caring for two children at home. She must have been hoping for Lennox and Auri to start playing together. Unfortunately, they just didn&apos;t seem to jive. Lennox didn&apos;t want to play with a baby; he had a much more interesting older brother. Natalie was stressed and she started painting. We were both subconsciously trying to address some dissatisfaction that we were experiencing at home, but we never gave it a name  or a shape. We just felt frustrated. In December, Auri was standing and nothing seemed wrong. We hoped it would continue to get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Event - December 23rd - December 25th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before Christmas, on December 23rd, Auri woke up with a reasonably high fever (I think it was &gt; 102F). She had slept through the night, but we could tell she wasn&apos;t feeling well. I sat in bed that morning and played her some music. She sat patiently, but looked distracted and disinterested. I remember being surprised that she wasn&apos;t more thrilled. She had always danced and really enjoyed music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christmas morning, we all fell ill. It was a subdued morning, and Natalie and I probably just phoned it in a bit. The kids were excited, but even they lacked a whole lot of enthusiasm. I remember feeling &lt;em&gt;drained&lt;/em&gt;, and you can see it in this picture of Auri. We didn&apos;t know it at the time, but we now think this illness precipitated what came next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Not Right - December 26th - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we visited friends that have a daughter close in age to Auri. I remember feeling like something was wrong, but not knowing how acute it was until seeing their daughter (a few months older) run around and chase the boys. Auri could barely crawl around and play with toys. Something wasn&apos;t right, and Natalie and I both knew it. By the week of January 1st, we felt like something was seriously wrong and we had to take action. Natalie phoned our pediatrician and asked for an immediate followup. During the visit, Auri weighed in at &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same weight that she had been a month and a half prior, and her &quot;slowness&quot; as the doctor described it prompted a call to Duke pediatric neurology for advice. The neurologist on call &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommended we bring her to the emergency room to expedite testing. A normal appointment and consultation might take weeks. We really weren&apos;t sure what to do, nor did we have any idea how serious it was. On Saturday night, Natalie and I went rollerskating on a date. We had a good time and didn&apos;t talk about Auri much. We didn&apos;t think it could be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; serious, and we were trying to turn a corner and focus on being more positive together and at home. This is the last time I can remember feeling care free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we wrestled with the idea of waiting to make an appointment. But after reviewing old pictures and videos that night, we realized that what had thought was some kind of developmental delay had unequivocally become developmental regression. We had been so focused on Auri&apos;s standing and attempts at walking that we completely missed her struggling to crawl and sit up. We made plans to take her first thing Monday morning, and I drafted notes to provide to the doctors with dates, milestones, and gained and lost skills. At this point, she could barely sit up and we hadn&apos;t really acknowledged how drastic her changes had been. In August, she was crawling around and sitting to play with her cousins at the beach. So much had changed so fast. Sunday night I tried to take a video of her sitting up, but she just fell over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Emergency Room Visit - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie hopped in the van with Auri just as soon as she woke up Monday morning and rushed to Duke. I had to take Max to school, and since Lennox was off from preschool, I took him with me to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed felt somewhat like a blur to me. I had fears that Auri might be suffering muscular dystrophy, and I kept asking about certain tests. I was so terrified that she would have a degenerative disease, but the markers I was concerned about came back normal. We didn&apos;t get any answers that morning, and I was forced to leave Natalie behind and head home to pick up Max. Still at the hospital, Natalie had to manage entertaining an infant through all the commotion. Without remembering the exact details of what happened, I know that they scheduled her for an MRI and a lot of blood work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t remember who helped put Max and Lennox to bed that night (it might have been Dan), but  after getting them ready, I hopped back into the car to drive to the hospital. On the way, Natalie sent me a &quot;where are you, hurry up&quot; kind of message. I just knew it meant she had something to share and I called her back. Somehow, one of the residents had committed a faux pas and read Natalie an excerpt of the preliminary MRI report. Natalie told me that they thought it was a leukodystrophy. I didn&apos;t know what that meant, and I almost crashed my car after looking it up while on the highway. I started hyperventilating and everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Week in the Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[With this update, I'd like to give everyone a sense of our weekly experience.

We have a lot of regular appointments with doctors and therapists, but right now they&apos;re largely focused on long term management. I believe that we&apos;re transitioning from an acute period of tests and diagnostics into a treatment plan that&apos;s looking optimistically forward. Behind us are ultrasounds of the heart and kidneys, hip x-rays, broad screening for viral illnesses, and a host of other tests that Auri passed without concern. Moving forward, we&apos;re focusing on monitoring changes from the drug she&apos;s taking and lots of therapy. In my opinion, the drug is working and Auri&apos;s in a category of moderate AGS severity. Relatively speaking, she&apos;s incredibly lucky to have a chance at mostly normal development. We&apos;re working on helping her catch back up. Again, I have to add the caveat that the doctors and scientists involved refuse to declare success, but that&apos;s because they need irrefutable evidence from more patients. For now, we simply need to make sure that she&apos;s at a safe dose and stays healthy. In good news, Cigna accepted our appeal and will be covering Auri&apos;s medication. I&apos;m sure that we would have found a way to keep going, but this will remove an extremely large financial burdern (at least $4k a month). Now, we&apos;re looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 30 days, we&apos;ve begun a comprehensive therapy program for Auri. She receives support from the state of &lt;a href=&quot;https://beearly.nc.gov/&quot;&gt;North Carolina&apos;s Infant Toddler Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program has helped us coordinate and schedule a number of different kinds of therapists to ensure that she&apos;s getting the opportunity to rebuild and regain skills. She most recently had an assessment by a speech therapist, which I&apos;ll go into further below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physical Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a week for an hour, a physical therapist comes to our home and works with Auri on gross motor development. Since she received her Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFOs), we&apos;ve been working on bearing weight on her legs and feet while standing and building strength in her core.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri&apos;s therapist will help her stand, make her reach across her body, etc. We tend to place her sitting on her heels, and let her play with toys at a raised cushion. We&apos;ve seen Auri redevelop  a lot of lost strength in her abdomen this way. Compared to a month ago, Auri&apos;s getting muscular. She might not have strong balance or coordination, but I&apos;ve definitely noticed and can feel a lot more muscle around her sides, back, and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feeding Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a week for thirty minutes, Natalie takes Auri to either Duke hospital or Duke&apos;s location in Brier Creek to work with a feeding therapist. They spend about a half an hour trying different foods, and more importantly, introducing different thicknesses of fluids and water. Our current goal with the therapist is to find the safest and most effective way to ensure that Auri is getting hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri recently had a video fluoroscopic swallowing exam done that uses an X-Ray machine to watch her swallow foods and liquids. She performed well, demonstrating a small amount of swallow fatigue. But, she manages food well and handles thicker liquids without aspirating. The report&apos;s prognosis was promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Prognosis: Fair for improved function with skilled speech pathology services focusing on stated goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Auri&apos;s occupational therapist, we work on development of fine motor skills. Once a week, and also in home, her therapist plays with her stacking blocks, passing things between her hands, etc. The therapist has boxes with little toys that she tries to get Auri to use both hands with. She has her press with her fingers on buttons and use toys that require her to  push hard with her hand. The goal here is to help her improve her hand coordination. Auri started to lose some skills with her fingers that she&apos;s been slowly regaining. At her worst, she began closing her hands and reaching for things in a closed fist or claw like manner. Since then, she&apos;s begun using open hands again and can help feed herself yogurt with a spoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speech Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New this week, we&apos;ve started Auri with a speech therapist. Although we haven&apos;t yet scheduled  these, the therapist is recommending twice a week, thirty minute appointments. I believe that this therapy will focus on helping Auri with expressive gestures and language. She&apos;ll be doing things like  making animal noises to build speech skills. The evaluation involved a big checklist of questions like, &quot;does she look at Dad when you say his name?&quot; The answers to the questions produce scores split by &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt; understanding and &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; use of speech and expression. Considering the circumstances, I&apos;m happy with how Auri performed. She&apos;s within the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt;, meaning she understands language and speech. And, she&apos;s just below the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; expression, meaning she&apos;s a little behind on developing sounds and gestures. I&apos;m not surprised that she has challenges, considering she&apos;s lost a couple of months of normal development. I&apos;m a little sad about this, but in the grand scheme of things it means we caught (and hopefully stopped) this disease before it claimed her intellectually. Before these changes, Auri was wickedly smart and expressive. I don&apos;t believe she&apos;s lost that, but it makes me wonder where she might be now had she the opportunity to run around and explore. Still, this is &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; news, and she will probably gain a lot from this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Ups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday, we take Auri to Duke to see Dr. K. At these appointments, they do a handful of blood tests and send a sample off for research. Right now, we&apos;re watching things like red and white blood cell counts, kidney and liver enzymes, and for signs of unexpected infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, things have been going well. I&apos;ve been watching slow changes in some of these values, but there has not been anything drastic. It&apos;s possible that they all settle where they are soon and we sit at the current medication dosage. At some point, probably after another few months, these follow ups will become fewer and farther between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like we&apos;ve really struggled here. We used to go out to dinner regularly as a family, meet up with friends, and spend more time together. Recently, we bought a portable chair that should provide Auri with enough support to sit anywhere we take her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out last night. Max had been asking for Sushi. It was a success! We had been waiting for this to make it through customs for about a month, and I&apos;m glad that it finally arrived. Since Auri can&apos;t sit in a high chair, it&apos;s been difficult for us to go places. Now I think we&apos;ll have more freedom and can get out of the house together more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Health Care, Equipment, Care Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in general, our deep dive into the health care system has been frustrating. We have a lot of bills coming in, some with mistakes. We&apos;ve also had to work through exclusive equipment providers to order some things like a pediatric stroller/wheelchair and a standing table. Over the past few weeks we&apos;ve had Auri measured for equipment and orthoses. For whatever reason, this process seems designed to make it both difficult and lengthy. I have a few tasks on my checklist to follow up and work some of this stuff out. Hopefully, Auri will get some helpful things soon. Next week we&apos;re fitting her for a support vest that should help her with core strength and coordination. We just recently bought this contraption, that lets Auri walk around this us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a few conversations scheduled to talk with different people about different foundations, services, and other financial support options that might be available to us. I believe that Auri will qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits from the Social Security Administration, and she will likely qualify for Medicaid to help pay co-pays and co-insurance. Right now, the financial cost of this isn&apos;t big on my list of concerns, but going forward we may need to do things like expand our house or renovate for accessibility. I&apos;ll be speaking with a lawyer next week about the possibility of opening a special needs trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day by Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, between Natalie and I, we juggle getting Max and Lennox ready and delivered to kindergarten and pre-school. The morning involves breakfast, dissolving and delivering Auri&apos;s medicine, dressing, brushing, packing lunches, etc. It&apos;s usually a bit of a dash, but they get there. There&apos;s almost always a therapy appointment of some kind before lunch, and then Natalie&apos;s feeding one or two kids before naptime. I&apos;m at home a day or two a week, but Natalie&apos;s usually managing this chaos on her own. When she&apos;s awake, Auri just wants to walk around endlessly. Right now that involves Natalie having to bend over and hold Auri up while she takes small steps around. If she takes a good nap, Natalie gets a little break before doing the same thing in the afternoon. It always feels a little crazy when I walk in the door, because the energy in the house with Max and Lennox can get a little much. It&apos;s been difficult to make everyone happy, so there&apos;s usually some argument about dinner, shower, etc. We&apos;re making it through, but I know that Natalie and I are both exhausted when everyone finally hits their bed. If we&apos;re lucky, and we aren&apos;t always, Auri will sleep through the night and we get a good rest. In the past couple of weeks, though, we&apos;ve had wet beds, vomiting, diarrhea, croupe, and some bad nights with everyone. Our boys have been sick with one thing or another, and Auri has been teething and acting restless. We&apos;re guessing that she&apos;s both learning a lot and dealing with a sore mouth, so she doesn&apos;t always sleep the best. We kind of take things day by day and it feels like a coin toss whether we&apos;ll get an easy or a hard one. It&apos;s starting to feel a little more like it did before all of this happened, though. Raising three children six and under isn&apos;t without its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren&apos;t easy, by any stretch of the imagination. But Natalie recalled recently that Dr. K reminded us that &quot;it could be much worse.&quot; I think that&apos;s probably the best way to  describe all of this and the ambivalence that we feel. Nobody wants something like this to happen to their child, but I follow the AGS family group on Facebook and it&apos;s really sad. For every child in Auri&apos;s condition or better, there&apos;s one or two that are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse. Without pulling together this treatment for Auri, I&apos;m certain she would have been in the &lt;em&gt;much worse&lt;/em&gt; category by now. I have so much empathy for those children and families, and it makes me grateful for where we are and the trends we&apos;re seeing. I think I might write another post soon detailing how we got here. This opportunity for Auri is truly remarkable and unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and caring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anxiety]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my past and with mixed success, I've fought my tendency to withdraw.

A good friend once described me as &quot;insular,&quot; and, admittedly, I&apos;m an introvert that prefers the predictability and control of my privacy. For over two months, unfortunately, that space has been a veritable nightmare: dreadful, unpredictable, and painful. Thus far I&apos;ve resisted the urge to engage in self pity, trying, rather, to focus on exhausting options for saving my daughter. But what left is there for me to do and how am I to feel now? Where do I direct my attention and from what well can I draw strength? We&apos;re alone, committed to an obscured path; and there&apos;s nothing more we can do. We move through the dark, in hope of protecting our daughter from further harm, a journey without a destination. Consequently, my personal space has been transformed into an enduring emotional struggle; and I&apos;m tired. Yet I&apos;ve been forced to come to terms these past two weeks with the insecurity that plagues our family now and forever. And, the feeling of being &lt;em&gt;apart&lt;/em&gt; has built tremendously since my last update. How do I answer a polite question like &quot;how are you today?&quot; Can I share how I really feel? Should I? With every friend, coworker, and family member, I&apos;m forced to politely withold. Is this real stoicism? The truth is too difficult. This must be why support groups exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why I&apos;m writing like this now, when I&apos;ve mostly stuck to the facts in my other updates. Well, I get asked often how Natalie and I are doing. I don&apos;t speak for Natalie. Even though I know she can relate to much of what I&apos;m sharing, still, I&apos;m never confident that I can really answer the question on her behalf. I can&apos;t even answer it on mine. Without exaggerating, I can tell you that my feelings change every hour. I swing between grief, fear, gratitude, and hope: grief for my daughter and the changes in our lives, fear that it may still get worse, gratitude for her remarkable opportunity, and hope that she can achieve a semi-normal life. As I watch Auri fluctuate, through colds, infections, and fatigue, I reckon with all of this and swing back and forth, sometimes within intervals of a few minutes. Imagine living on a world that experienced earthquakes with the same period. You&apos;d be in a state of constant panic. How would you deal? Could you go on a date and keep from crying in public? We can&apos;t, but we can still smile for a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is, my best answer to the &quot;how are you&quot; question. I&apos;m sure that some can relate, and I don&apos;t think we&apos;re unique. But most can&apos;t. When this all started I just tried to help everyone understand that it was better to say nothing. Trying to find the right thing to say or trying to empathize with an incomparable experience just kind of hurt more. I think that remains true. The depth of this, the biggest and most difficult experience of my life (past, present, and future), can&apos;t be communicated and will remain largely unspoken of. I&apos;m grateful that I have a partner who can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn&apos;t subscribe to hear me complain. You want to know how Auri&apos;s been doing since my last update. Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t answer the question with any confidence until yesterday. Since March 9th, Auri has been stuggling with an eye infection, on and off low-grade fevers, and the eruption of her first two teeth. She hasn&apos;t slept well or predictably, has been weak and tired, hasn&apos;t eaten or nursed well, and has had us all sorts of worried. Despite all of this, I had been communicating my belief that it was temporary, a consequence of infection or teething; but, to be honest, I&apos;m not sure what portion of that belief was just hope. We wrestled with a lot of doubt this week. Fortunately, the belief doesn&apos;t appear to have been misplaced and Auri really seems to be back on track. As before, the rails are being laid as we travel, and I can&apos;t dismiss the likelihood of future derailments. In fact, I fear another cold is on the horizon (from some sneezing and coughing). There&apos;s no rest for the weary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good news, here&apos;s Auri &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/E99jfQ5vXCreiUJTA&quot;&gt;taking some cautious sips of thickened water&lt;/a&gt; today. We&apos;ve been unsuccessfully trying to find a way to increase her fluid intake. She&apos;s been refusing everything we&apos;ve tried until yesterday. With this cup and to build her confidence, we&apos;re letting her take small sips of thickened water. Of course, this comes with her recovery this weekend and wouldn&apos;t have been reasonable last week. Nonetheless, there were a few moments between the sickly naps and crying that had me thinking she was still avoiding the progression of her disease. She&apos;s been playing the &quot;how big is Auri? So big!&quot; game with Natalie, lifting her arms above her head (so long as she&apos;s laying down). After work one evening, we laid on our backs and I held up a children&apos;s tablet for her to play with. She was passing the stylus between her hands and clearly enjoying scratching pictures on the screen. I haven&apos;t observed any neurological changes, and she&apos;s still feeling much better than she was at her lowest. Also, she really likes nutella...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote to appeal our insurance company&apos;s denial of her medication. My letter cited all the relevant research, and I provided a folder of about fifteen articles from various journals. One of these days I&apos;ll write about how we leveraged this research to get her treatment, but right now I&apos;m hoping it suits this purpose. I burned a whole cartridge of ink and delivered over a hundred pages after Cigna determined, &quot;with the information they had,&quot; that Auri&apos;s condition &quot;does not involve an imminent and serious threat to the health of the member.&quot; They&apos;ve denied the medication on the basis that there isn&apos;t enough evidence for its use. I&apos;m really not sure what the outcome will be, but I&apos;ve tried my best. The price of her medication wouldn&apos;t just bankrupt us, it would make the treatment impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got some data this week. Auri&apos;s lab results provide molecular confirmation of an intereferonopathy. Between her first sample (before medication) and ten days after beginning baricitinib, expression of her interferon stimulated genes reduced significantly. I had hoped for results from her third sample before claiming anything definitive, but the initial data is encouraging. We&apos;ll need to see more samples, given that these levels would be expected to fluctuate during illnesses. I suspect that we&apos;ll see a positive trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Trip to Philadelphia to Gather More Information]]></title><description><![CDATA[Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She&apos;s leading research and treatment of AGS in the U.S. and had lot of information and observations to relate about both Auri&apos;s disease and medication. I left a little disheartened by our conversation, but not because of anything we&apos;re doing or currently witnessing. It&apos;s just undeniable that Auri&apos;s disease will be lifelong and difficult. Thankfully though, there&apos;s every reason to believe that what we&apos;re doing for her now will be extremely advantageous to her quality of life. Although nobody will outright say it, the medication she&apos;s taking is presumed to be successful at stopping neurological regression and encouraging for managing her future struggle with secondary complications. Consequently, Natalie and I remain hopeful but will forever be in a state of fear that the next setback lies around the corner. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re going to handle that constant stress, and I worry about the consequences for Max and Lennox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for both of my parents this week. My mother watched Max and Lennox back home while we were gone, and my father met us in Philadelphia to chauffer and provide support. Sometimes it feels like we can barely handle ourselves and Auri, let alone two older boys and two dogs (one with cancer no less). Every moment that somebody entertains our kids and gives us a chance to decompress helps tremendously. I&apos;m looking forward to a visit by my cousin and her girls, and similarly thankful for my aunt&apos;s visit a couple of weeks a go. We need distractions because whenever I&apos;m sitting still I&apos;m worried. At any moment, Auri could start slipping through our fingers again; and she&apos;s struggling so hard to hold herself together. I&apos;m finding it impossible to not obsess about every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Cold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri&apos;s turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, but despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven&apos;t appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn&apos;t fully cleared up, she&apos;s pretty much back to normal sleep and I&apos;m hopeful that the worst has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we&apos;re panicking. We &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt; that Auri makes it through this and future illnesses without difficulty because any could trigger a disease flare. In a way, I feel like we&apos;re treading open water, one storm and big wave away from going under. Although she&apos;s still able to eat solids and drink pureed fruits and yogurt, Auri can&apos;t swallow plain water. Any further loss of feeding ability or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we&apos;re desperately trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and continued health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week. Unfortunately, with two toddlers in school, there&apos;s not a whole lot we can do to keep her away from bugs and germs while she regains her strength. We nervously wait, watch, and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes from CHOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country&apos;s  (and probably the world&apos;s) experts in AGS. They&apos;re also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we&apos;ve managed to get prescribed locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Dr. Vanderver related the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become more available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Based on a quick assessment, Dr. Vanderver guessed that Auri may suffer a &quot;moderate&quot; disease course (or somewhere in the middle of the disease spectrum), but I have my doubts about this based on the frightening slide that we witnessed in February. The team at CHOP thought that we might have disrupted the disease somewhere in the middle of a regressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri&apos;s life. Her risk of neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything definitive. Allowing for conjecture based on limited observations, we can hope that CHOP&apos;s three-year monitoring of patients on this drug suggests a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver shared that they have not seen a patient&apos;s neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats; most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure. We can&apos;t say that the drug is working nor can we treat it like a magic bullet. We received a sobering list of things to watch for, both drug and disease related, that underscore the seriousness of what we&apos;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&apos;ve left with encouraging news. They&apos;ve treated a child as young as two months of age that has appeared to benefit. Relatively speaking, there haven&apos;t been any significant, adverse drug induced events for the children they&apos;re treating. And, they have had children successfully on this drug for multiple years. Considering that CHOP continues to prescribe and research this medication for these children, we can assume that there&apos;s a reasonable benefit to the patients. Our uncertainty about whether we are seeing improvements so quickly has also been resolved. I&apos;d read this previously, but Dr. Vanderver confirmed that the drug &quot;works immediately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that continues to support us. For now, we believe that things are still going well and moving in a positive direction. Auri&apos;s much happier than she was before we started her medication and she continues to put on weight and slowly improve. We&apos;re in the process of ordering assistive equipment (like a supportive chair, standing table, and stroller) that should make things a little easier on us. We&apos;re all adjusting and trying to experience each day with grace and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, this week has put to rest however worried I&apos;ve been about inflating Auri&apos;s progress. Of course, I just can&apos;t continue without adding that there&apos;s a long way to go and a lot of unknowns. But, with that said, I&apos;d like to share that others have confirmed our observations and remarked on Auri&apos;s improvement. On Tuesday and Thursday, we&apos;ve had followups with Auri&apos;s doctor managing treatment and her neurologist, respectively. Both have said that she&apos;s doing notably better than when they had last seen her. For our neurologist, it has been over a month, during which Auri had gotten much, much worse. This indicates a really strong bounce back that has been, to me, literally unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago and only just after starting her medicine, Auri was feeling better but &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA&quot;&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she&apos;s progressively engaging her core muscles more and holding her body and head up better. Day by day we see continued improvement and I try to take notes of anything new. This past week, Auri has been extending her arms more and reaching over her head, dancing, and bouncing in the tub to make waves. These are little things, but they represent a strengthening of her core and neck muscles that had gotten much harder for her to control. Although she&apos;s not crawling yet, she has tried to get her knees up and pull herself forward in an army crawl. All this is happening for a girl that had two weeks ago largely stopped moving or twisting while on her back. I&apos;ve even caught her waking up from a nap &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; doing happy baby pose (on her back reaching out toward her pulled in feet). And, she&apos;s gained almost a pound (13 oz) in about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These small improvements continue to stack, in defiance of my reticence to celebrate them. Given how much we&apos;ve been grieving, I needed an expert to weight in before I could believe it. I can&apos;t really describe how much better we&apos;re all feeling, so if a picture is worth a thousand words, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/LxwLZ8MeyRvv7txQA&quot;&gt;a video is worth a million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Auri and Hope, Into the Unknown]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having started Auri's drug therapy, we're inching into the unknown, still carrying the fear that has caused us indescribable grief.

However, this week has brought us hope, something we haven&apos;t felt in what feels like an eternity. Last month I was certain we were losing our girl, but a spectrum of possibilities is opening before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re cautiously watching Auri feel better and get a little stronger. I would never have believed it if you had told me that I would be celebrating my daughter simply lifting her head up, but a picture from Natalie of her sitting up in a grocery cart brought me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the little things right now that both encourage and terrify me. Before we began this therapy, every day since December had been worse than the one before it. Since Saturday, February 16th, every day has been better. Is it too soon to celebrate? Of course. But, am I scrutinizing every moment? Of course. Something is happening, but it will be much longer before we know exactly what, why, and whether it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confounding Factors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, Natalie and I believe that we&apos;ve observed improvement after Auri has had blood taken for lab tests. At first we thought we were making it up, but now that we understand her disease better it seems plausible. When she loses blood, the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I&quot;&gt;interferon cytokines&lt;/a&gt; in her system would be temporarily reduced. Both on Tuesday and Thursday before starting her drug, she gave a large amount of blood to screen for viruses and other signs of infection. Additionally, children with AGS sometimes suffer flares when they get sick. The primary cause of this disease involves the immune system chaotically signaling viral infection where there is none. A simple cold could make things worse, and the week before starting this drug Auri had a bad one. Her cold had just started to break as we started the drug, and we&apos;d expect that alone to make her feel better. We&apos;ve seen that effect before, but her temporary improvement has never been as strong as we&apos;re seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting on Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, we still don&apos;t have any data on Auri&apos;s interferon levels. It might tell us something about the severity of her disease and how it was progressing. Until we receive a few data points showing a reduction in her body&apos;s response to the disease, it&apos;s impossible for us to even confirm AGS let alone efficacy of the drug she&apos;s taking. Frankly, we got started in haste. She was getting worse every day and there simply was not time to waste. Though we still don&apos;t have all the details, the diagnosis is pretty certain. In the coming weeks, we&apos;re hoping to get data demonstrating beyond a doubt that we&apos;re observing measurable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve gotten some questions about the drug that I can answer. It&apos;s a chemical called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baricitinib&quot;&gt;baricitinib&lt;/a&gt; in a small pill that Auri takes multiple times a day. We can&apos;t trust her to swallow a pill, so thankfully it dissolves very easily in a tiny amount of water that we mix with yogurt. So far we haven&apos;t had any difficulties, and she&apos;s been tolerating it without obvious side effects. However, the side effects that we will be concerned about would take time to  develop. The drug acts by interrupting her cells&apos; ability to recognize and respond to certain signals. While it targets the immune signals that her disease is sending into overdrive, it also interrupts some hormones, like those from the kidneys that control blood cell production. In a multi-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026004/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the drug for different but very related reasons, children received and tolerated baricitinib well for an average of 3.5 years. For these children, the alternatives just simply aren&apos;t acceptable and &lt;strong&gt;the modest risk that this drug poses is heavily outweighed by the severity of their disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encouraging Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a day or two of Auri starting this drug, we noticed some small but remarkable improvements in her general attitude. Having slept poorly for over a week, Auri went through the night without complaint. She switched from two naps a day to a single, appearing less tired and fatigued over all. Within another day or two, she was holding herself up better. One of the most distressing changes over the past month has been how &lt;em&gt;loose&lt;/em&gt; she&apos;s gotten when you pick her up. Having mostly laid on my shoulder when carried, she&apos;s begun to engage her back muscles again and sit up more in my arms. She&apos;s also using her voice more. In the car on the way back from Duke this Tuesday, she was talking up a storm. Having talked much less over the month of February (sticking mostly to &quot;mama&quot;), she&apos;s bringing back some baby talk that had mostly disappeared. At physical therapy, she had a strong day. Her ability to participate in PT has gotten progressively worse, week by week. This past Thursday, she was able to kneel and crawl with help. We even just got back from the pool, where Auri continued to show increased strength and coordination. I&apos;m too nervous to call it a trend yet, but I hope this continues.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug therapy I&apos;ve mentioned has risks, hasn&apos;t been tested enough in children, but has shown some promising results. We were told last week that it wasn&apos;t an option. With the help of some great people, we pulled together a team that includes doctors at Duke and the NIH. One has extensive experience with this drug and related diseases, the other (and our primary specialist) cares for children undergoing complex treatments. They escalated Auri&apos;s case and decided Tuesday that they are going to do this for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow Auri will be given a dangerous weapon to fight with. It terrifies me, but she doesn&apos;t have any other choice. Should this work for her, she will remain immunocompromised for years, perhaps her entire childhood and longer. We&apos;ve been told it may take 4 months to have confidence that it&apos;s really working, but parents have witnessed an immediate (albeit modest) overall improvement. Auri may be one of fewer than a handful of children ever to be granted this opportunity, early enough to make a real difference. I trust that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must follow Mary Oliver&apos;s advice from her poem, &quot;Love Sorrow,&quot; and smile, lest our girl forget the world before the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Love sorrow. She is yours now, and you must
take care of what has been
given. Brush her hair, help her
into her little coat, hold her hand,
especially when crossing a street. For, think,

what if you should lose her? Then you would be
sorrow yourself; her drawn face, her sleeplessness
would be yours. Take care, touch
her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone. And smile, that she does not
altogether forget the world before the lesson.
Have patience in abundance. And do not
ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself, which is to say, possibly, again,
abandoned. She is strange, mute, difficult,
sometimes unmanageable but, remember, she is a child.
And amazing things can happen. And you may see,

as the two of you go
walking together in the morning light, how
little by little she relaxes; she looks about her;
she begins to grow.”

― Mary Oliver, Red Bird

I&apos;ll cut to chase and tell you that of the 285 patients with data available for a global study, 73.7% ended up &quot;profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function.&quot; The disease is characterized by an onset within the first two years of life that results in deterioration of the brain lasting &quot;several months&quot; (in my reading anywhere from 1 to 12 months, seemingly around 8 months). At that point, the brain deterioration appears to stop and not continue. Rather, patients suffer long term, chronic, autoimmune disease (sometimes similar to lupus, sometimes milder) and the serious consequences of their disability. Generally, this seems to include intellectual disability (although Auri&apos;s early MRI didn&apos;t indicated damage in the basal ganglia that might make it worse). Mortality rates in childhood are high (20%), but it seems more likely to claim kids that present very early or right after birth with serious complications. The natural course of this disease seems like it will leave Auri alive, but severely disabled. We&apos;ve been witness to Auri&apos;s steady and progressive deterioration for at least a couple of months. We don&apos;t know if nor when it will stop, nor how much of her will remain when it does. Our hope is for an immediate cessation of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some hope. Auri&apos;s mutation has not been inherited. It was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation; which means that once confirmed there will be no need to test anybody else (including Max and Lennox). Additionally, the disease mechanics and involved genes are fairly well understood as a type 1 interferon autoimmune disorder. What does that mean? It means that there are effective drugs that are being used for other immune disorders that involve the same pathway (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). In fact, within the last couple of years and in a handful of cases they&apos;ve been used with success for AGS. However, to the best of my knowledge and research, there has never been an AGS patient confirmed this early nor offered this treatment before or during the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. It stands to reason that it could have a profound impact on her outcome. Unfortunately, I&apos;m under the impression that the FDA status of these drugs has very recently changed and that they might not be available for compassionate use. We may need a clinical researcher to devise or revise a clinical study to make them accessible for treatment. I have absolutely no idea how difficult it will be to make this happen, but I intend to pour everything I can into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spoken via e-mail with the researcher involved in trialing therapies for AGS and he pointed me toward a couple of studies. There have only been a few. Here&apos;s before and after video of treatment with an immunomodulator initiated 16 months after disease onset (much, much later than Auri and after the neurodegenerative episode). I don&apos;t have the genetic results yet to confirm whether he shares exactly the same mutation, but the same gene is involved. He also presented signs and symptoms at a relatively similar time. Even the description of his MRI at 16 months of age sounds similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I&apos;m hoping that there&apos;s a way to keep this disease from stealing our daughter entirely. However, we must assume that our lives and hers will be harrowingly different than what we had expected. We&apos;re grateful for all the expressions of support that we&apos;ve received from friends and family. I&apos;m beholden to Natalie for the incredible strength she&apos;s demonstrated for Auri and me. I think that together we can keep our family in one piece, but I&apos;m terrified of the price we&apos;re going to pay. Please think and send positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's Suspected Disease]]></title><description><![CDATA[At this point I think everyone has heard the term "leukodystrophy," and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where…]]></description><link>https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At this point I think everyone has heard the term &quot;leukodystrophy,&quot; and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where Auri is at. I&apos;m not sure how long we&apos;ve been concerned about her, but I think we always noticed that she hasn&apos;t develop as fast or early as Max and Lennox. For the most part, though, she hit her milestones until about 12 months (middle of November). She failed her assessment for gross motor development (crawling, pulling up, walking, etc.). We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but around Christmas we all got sick, Auri with fever. We were all beat up until after New Years, and we noticed that Auri didn&apos;t bounce back. It really took the wind out of her and she started struggling. We looked at some old pictures and videos and realized she had been regressing. She doesn&apos;t sit up by herself, can&apos;t really get out of sitting or do it unassisted, and was generally struggling to crawl around. We took her to the E.R. at Duke on Monday. She had an MRI that shows abnormal white matter changes in her brain that &quot;raise concerns for leukodystrophy.&quot; They took spinal fluid samples, blood, etc. and sent them out for analysis and genetic testing. So far, every test for something simple has been normal; but the ones for the scary stuff won&apos;t send results for a week or two. We&apos;re just waiting. Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for this likelihood because everyone involved in her case has been in agreement that it does look like a leukodystrophy. By now you&apos;ve googled; you can imagine my terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I figured you might be relieved to see that my butter bean is laughing and playing. We&apos;re spending a lot of quality time with her. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen, but I&apos;m happy if we noticed early because she&apos;s still a lot of fun.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m grateful for all of your love. Just wish the best for her and my boys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
