&lt;h2&gt;Slowing Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading in to Mother&apos;s Day, I think Natalie and I had been feeling a little defeated. For whatever reason, Auri seems to be feeling the same way. She&apos;s been adjusting (or perhaps adapting) to her circumstances, but this means she&apos;s been less enthusiastic about the hard work needed to regain the skills she&apos;s lost. Watching her cousin Tom crawl around the room like Speedy Gonzalez, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/T1YRhQUUoD2Xv2YAA&quot;&gt;struggling to army crawl&lt;/a&gt;; but she was at least trying. It hurts to see her like this, but not nearly as much as it hurts to see her give up. Both Natalie and I scrutinize everything Auri does, so this decreasing enthusiasm has caused a great deal of anxiety and panic in us. We&apos;ve developed (and fought) doubts about Auri&apos;s trajectory, and we&apos;ve been worried about backsliding. I can&apos;t emphasize enough how deeply this anxiety has embedded itself into our lives. The only cure for this is time. I keep saying it and hoping that we get through this year quickly, but I&apos;m trying a lot harder to make sure I don&apos;t have my eyes closed. We began Auri&apos;s treatment looking up, possibly naive about the long, difficult road ahead. I believe that we&apos;re finally coming to terms with the kind of parents and family that we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping Steady&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectively, though, I think Auri is still improving, just slowly. Auri&apos;s therapists have observed and shared some subtle but important things like Auri lifting a leg while standing and shifting her weight, having more strength in her arms for maintaining balance, and using new consonants and expressions to communicate. We hoped for more, but I maintain the belief that we&apos;ll feel much better a year from now. This will not speed up in a day or a month. To be honest, it might not ever. But, we&apos;re moving forward. I&apos;ll never forget the fear of watching it move backward. This is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the opportunity to take Auri to physical therapy yesterday, and I was amazed at how hard she was working. I&apos;ve never pushed her so much at home. She needs a lot of support, of course, but she&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/8dUh4JHg3tmqSEwz8&quot;&gt;climbing up slides&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;recovering&quot; from different positions, building core strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regaining Skills Will Take Time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shared this picture on the Facebook recently. It had a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; profound effect on me emotionally. Auri can&apos;t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; do this, but Natalie captured something that she might be able to do with confidence in the future. She&apos;s working hard, it&apos;s just going to take a lot of time. I grabbed &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/itMC9qTjfSxtUX1h8&quot;&gt;a video of her practicing in her walker&lt;/a&gt;, and you can see how hard this is going to be. It will take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;All is Not Lost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/wkQ1Dcciko56ysqQA&quot;&gt;Playing with the computer at the doctor&apos;s office&lt;/a&gt;, I think you can see that Auri has a reasonable future. It might not be the one any of us had wished for her, but Auri&apos;s going to be alright. She can sit at a table, mess around with stuff, push buttons when she focuses. As she gets older, I&apos;d expect her to have more patience and concentration. It should help a lot. At a year and a half of age, she&apos;s just throwing herself at whatever she wants to do. Eventually she&apos;ll plan and practice, and she&apos;s going to do everything more effectively. This is a far cry from what I had been worried about. When this all happened and &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; hit rock bottom, I kept begging and pleading that I&apos;d at least be able to have a conversation with her in a few years. Now I think I&apos;ll be able to. Our daughter has lost a lot, but not everything. She may very well tell me in a few years that I was overreacting. We may &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/k2g9Lkowk8bdQrUg8&quot;&gt;swing&lt;/a&gt; through highs and lows, but I&apos;m grateful for where we are and what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Swimming!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ve recently looked into aquatic physical therapy, thinking that it would be really beneficial for Auri. Thankfully, our neighborhood pool opened this weekend and showed us just how great it will be. On Saturday, Auri had a fantastic time &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ggyTYnXvekduKnny9&quot;&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, splashing, and thrashing about. We&apos;ve spent a couple of weeks starting to feel disappointed and worried that she&apos;s hasn&apos;t been trying as hard, but then I saw and felt her moving in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Onward, Max!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we celebrate Max&apos;s sixth birthday, and I&apos;ve never been prouder of him. He&apos;s really the most thoughtful and kind hearted person. And, he&apos;s too smart. Walking the neighborhood this week, Lennox started talking about how it was night time because the sun was &quot;going down.&quot; Max let him know that the sun never actually &lt;em&gt;moves&lt;/em&gt;. It stays put while the Earth rotates. I&apos;ve been saying stuff like this to him for years, and he keeps showing me that he not only listens but understands. He&apos;s a great kid. Here he is helping Lennox water the berries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives flipped upside down, but I&apos;m grateful to have such a strong partner. She&apos;s become a veritable super mom, carrying my daughter and my children through insanely difficult times. She carries me too, but that&apos;s not what today is about. That&apos;s not what this post is about. This is about how grateful I am that my daughter has a mother so committed to helping us achieve her best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Auri first started her troubles, I fell into a dark and sorrowful place. Natalie kept going. She never gave up hope, and she continues to look forward with an optimism that I know will give Auri every opportunity. Where my back is sore from thirty minutes of playing, Natalie won&apos;t stop walking with Auri until the sun goes down. She&apos;s up early every morning, making sure my daughter gets as much out of the day as possible. Natalie has grown in the past few months and blossomed into somebody really special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have never have guessed where we would be, but thank goodness for such a wonderful mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frantic Research - January 24th - January 25th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t sleep the night that we received Auri&apos;s diagnosis, not because I was sad or nervous but because I couldn&apos;t stop researching. I began reading everything I could about AGS, and a particular name kept popping up. Yanick Crow seemed to be an author on every important paper. He had penned a comprehensive overview of the disease in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and even coined the term &quot;interferonopathies&quot; to describe a category of diseases with a similar pathology. He was leading one of the two clinical trials using reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs - HIV drugs) and had theorized quite a bit over the last ten years about potential therapies. The next morning, I found his e-mail address and wrote him. A portion follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m reaching out in hopes of learning about early indications of efficacy within your RTI trial for AGS patients. We need to develop a plan of therapy (or understand the necessity of a trial) as soon as possible in the hopes of arresting or reducing [Auri&apos;s] neurological decline. I understand that these trials likely monitor interferon alpha levels in patients &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; their acute neurologic episode, but with very little in the literature about other scenarios we&apos;re looking to understand and try anything of use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he replied quickly and provided me with the clinical research he had been involved in with JAK inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We and others are trying to work out if the drugs that are currently available make a difference at the neurological level (I attach the papers that we have published on JAK inhibition), but I have to admit that it is not completely straightforward to know that (it is one thing to see an effect at, say, the level of the skin, another matter in regards to the brain).&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already read a ton the night before and had some context for his conservative reply. At least a handful of papers had discussed the theory behind JAK inhibition, and it seemed like it had been guessed that it could be a promising therapy for AGS. I blew past his warnings, thrilled at least that I had received a response and been on to something. Encouragingly, I also had success contacting CHOP on Friday and began the process of authorizing medical record release and signing up for their research studies. I started to feel some relief that we not only knew what we were dealing with, but there seemed to be experts and options. Surely we&apos;d find something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Contacts - January 25th - January 29th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 25th, after speaking with CHOP&apos;s research coordinator, I put together a bunch  of pictures and videos of Auri. I had hoped to demonstrate to them how early we had intervened in Auri&apos;s disease, so that they might register the importance of acting quickly. I shared videos of her eating, playing, and standing. It felt like we were getting connected to the team that we needed the most.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 27th, our neurologist received word from CHOP that made me simultaneously hopeful and frustrated. It seemed to confirm that JAK inhibition, which had been tried with success by Dr. Crow, had been working in their clinical trial. Unfortunately, their clinical trial was closed. The principal investigator wrote as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect to re-open our trial of baricitib soon, though we are not enrolling yet. It is a janus kinase inhibitor, and we think blocks the IFN mediated end organ damage. We see moderate success, in particular for these kids with later onset.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following days, I scheduled a clinical visit with CHOP for February 21st and set up to have blood samples sent to them for testing the activity of &quot;interferon stimulated genes.&quot; The scores computed from these samples would confirm whether Auri had this disease and possibly tell us something about its severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to Figure Out What to Do - January 29th - February 4th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some confusion about the state of things, and I spoke with a college friend of mine, an M.D. that works in the University fo Colorado hospital. He assured me that since baricitinib had been approved by the FDA for an indication, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be prescribed for any other reason. It was just a matter of finding a doctor that would prescribe &quot;off-label.&quot; It became clear that CHOP either could not or would not participate. A nurse practitioner described the situation to me over the phone as a Catch-22, and assured me that they would be restarting their clinical trial (&lt;em&gt;side-note: it&apos;s May 2nd as I write and they still haven&apos;t opened another trial&lt;/em&gt;). I have more empathy now for the awkwardness of the situation; they&apos;re working diligently to collect data in &lt;em&gt;controlled&lt;/em&gt; experiments to undeniably demonstrate this therapies safety and efficacy for helping &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;. This is no light matter, and we&apos;re taking risks not knowing what the long term effects of this will be. Nonetheless, on February 3rd, I replied to an e-mail from CHOP&apos;s research coordinator asking about whether we were able to send blood samples. I was really upset:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I received your message, but I&apos;m contemplating next steps. I was hopeful that your organization would be willing to either treat or guide treatment for Aurelia much sooner. February 21st represents an unacceptable delay to me and further loss of my daughter&apos;s QOL. Without any guarantees from CHOP, I&apos;m hoping to pursue anti-JAK therapy at Duke. With any luck, we&apos;ll be discussing options this week with our team here. Assuming they take the lead, I&apos;m certain they&apos;ll want to measure interferon levels. I don&apos;t want to submit Auri to any redundant or unnecessary blood draws.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, with all of this happening in the background, our neurologist replied to me after what felt like an eternity to assure me that she wanted to treat Auri:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m in agreement with your sense of timing needing to move quickly. I am going to get pieces in place for JAK meds if we need to do them here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looked difficult, though. The drug hasn&apos;t been studied well for this use, and barely at all in children. What&apos;s more, Auri&apos;s situation was unique. My research had confirmed what our neurologist described:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In general- the treated people I can find have not been in a clinical situation similar to Auri, so we are in very very uncharted waters here as far as effects of treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell, there hadn&apos;t been a single child with AGS that had undergone this treatment at this stage of the disease. It was simply unknown whether it could halt the neurological damage, and everyone I spoke with offered caution about jumping to conclusions. (I later found out that this was not entirely true, but the children that have had interventions with JAK inhibitors could still be counted on one hand.) Still, the rationale in research seemed strong; and it didn&apos;t seem surprising that it hadn&apos;t been tried like this yet with such a rare disease. Auri had been diagnosed remarkably quickly. I couldn&apos;t understand why everyone wasn&apos;t jumping at the opportunity to help her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Out of Options - February 5th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dejected - Morning February 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a morning phone call with our neurologist on February 5th that destroyed my hopes for treatment at Duke.  I took this call in a small conference room at my office. I sat at a desk and took notes while we spoke. The team at Duke simply didn&apos;t have enough experience, evidence, or research to make this happen. And, CHOP wouldn&apos;t assist; they had a responsibility to establish evidence of this therapy working in AGS before participating in treatment of children outside of their study. However, if they thought through their research that it was working and knew that they couldn&apos;t re-open their clinical trial in time, I couldn&apos;t understand why they would not help. Our doctor didn&apos;t have the answers, and she seemed disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t know what to say. If there was nothing we could do, we were back where we started, hopeless. I had been grieving for weeks, assuming that I was going to lose my daughter. The diagnosis and my research had let me begin to believe that there was a solution and that we could save her. As it turned out, there was more experience with and evidence for the promise of this therapy than I had known. I felt so low, but I had to finish the remainder of the day at work. In what reflects the seriousness of the situation, our doctor had suggested to me a few weeks prior that I focus on enjoying what time remained with Auri. Until this point I had been unable to slow or calm down. Ending the phone call, I remember assuring her that I would do so now. Paraphrasing, my response to her &quot;we can&apos;t save your daughter&quot; was &quot;then it&apos;s a good thing I&apos;m spending quality time with her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I Might as Well Try - February 5th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed like every door had closed, but their was still one loose thread. Dr. Rafaela Goldbach-Manksy and her group at the NIH had originally established the treatment and monitoring protocol that was being used by CHOP. I didn&apos;t know enough about her group&apos;s work at the time, but I was aware that my doctor had attempted and failed to make contact with her. I thought that I might as well try to reach out. Maybe I could still make something happen. I called. She didn&apos;t answer. I left a voicemail. I recently wrote her a thank you, and I&apos;ll just let it tell how I had felt in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;... returning my phone call, gave me renewed hope on the very day that I had lost it. I had just navigated an entire month of grief, panic, and fear that included a humbling acknowledgement of a problem in my previously healthy child, a terrifying suggestion of a likely fatal leukodystrophy, panic that my other children might meet the same fate, the paradoxical relief and devastation of a rapid genetic diagnosis of a de-novo mutation for AGS, the hope of promising clinical trials, and finally the somber disillusionment that said treatment would be inaccessible to Auri when she needed it. Throughout most of January, I sat helpless while my daughter turned to sand and began slipping faster and faster through my fingers. As soon as I received Auri’s genetic report, I got to work on research. As a graduate student of computer science, I worked for Richard Bonneau at NYU’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. I felt uncommonly prepared to ensure that my daughter had the best options. I read so much. I took notes. I contacted PI’s. Within a few days, I became convinced that JAK blockade represented an astounding and perhaps unprecedented opportunity for Auri. Unfortunately, I quickly found myself helpless again. Our neurologist shared my eagerness to treat Auri promptly but was unable to garner the necessary support, neither in nor outside of Duke. We would have to wait until CHOP began enrolling in a follow-up trial. Auri’s doctor and I had a difficult conversation that ended with something to the effect of “good luck,” knowing full well that Auri faced an overwhelming likelihood of neurological devastation. That same afternoon after work, waiting in line to pick up my son from kindergarten and after having cried the entire drive, I decided to try calling you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought Max home and went through the motions with the kids: dinner, shower, book, bed. I couldn&apos;t believe that all of my efforts were going to come up short. I felt like I had worked so hard. At this point, I was in tears most nights in bed; and this evening was particularly rough. Lights off, trying to sleep, my phone buzzed. I received a text message from an unknown number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you for your message. We do not have a protocol for AGS but please send me your e-mail and I will send you our dosing data. The neurologists in North Carolina should be able to prescribe baricitinib as it is approved.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;HOLY FUCK!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; I shouted. I can&apos;t remember what I did after that, but it wasn&apos;t sleep. I&apos;m certain I replied, carefully, acknowledging where things stood and what I was trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Regression - February 5th - 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we waited, I kept researching. As much as I was capable, I tried to build an understanding of the disease and it&apos;s mechanics. I kept telling Natalie that I could understand what I was reading, but it was really hard to connect papers because I had no background knowledge. I had no recall, and simply couldn&apos;t remember details about what I had read the day before. I was trying to pull something together with little to no relevant education. It was incredibly frustrating. While I was doing this, Auri got sick again and this time it seemed much worse. Based on what we understood about her disease, it was possible that she could be less severely affected and stop worsening. What we witnessed this week seemed to make it clear that Auri&apos;s decline continued, and she was running out of skills to lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events of the week had me in a panic. Auri had been sick, likely worsening her disease; and she wasn&apos;t sleeping. Natalie had spent every night of the week on cushions on the floor of Auri&apos;s room. She was waking, crying every hour, if she was even able to fall back asleep. I had joined an AGS family support group on Facebook, and, if I remember correctly, somebody had asked this week about how others help their kids sleep. Parent after parent shared that their kids awoke multiple times at night during the best of times, some because they were unable to shift themselves or roll over. Seeing what could happen and reading about others&apos; outcomes, I was a wreck. Auri was becoming &quot;floppy,&quot; an actual medical term describing a lack of muscle tone. We would pick her up and she felt like a sack of potatoes, with absolutely no strength in her back to sit up in our arms and look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I had called Dr. Fatemi&apos;s office at the Kennedy Krieger Institute hoping for other options. I believe, at the time, that he was the chairman of the United Leukodystrophy Foundation. Through a surrogate, he replied that his organization (and most others) refer AGS patients to CHOP due to their experience with anti-JAK therapy. Another door that I knocked on failed to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Frantic Plea for Help - Evening of February 8th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Friday evening rolled around, I checked out of the family routine. I decided that I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to do something and got started immediately after work. I sat on the couch downstairs, while everyone else ate dinner and did bedtime, and began to make a list of people to contact. I started with every member of the United Leukodystrophy Foundation&apos;s medical advisory board, and began including authors from anti-JAK research papers that I thought could be relevant. Dr. G had told me that she was aware that some patients had achieved private insurance approval/coverage of the drug, and that made me think some of the doctors involved might be using this drug outside of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lot of e-mails that night, trying to stay professional but understanding that this was really a last ditch effort. I had also been asking parents in the support group whether any of them had any other ideas or people to contact. During the week I had contacted a doctor from a different children&apos;s hospital based on their advice, and this evening I received another name that I reached out to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I knew that this drug therapy was complex and required careful and constant monitoring. I would have been willing to do just about anything (I had in fact told Dr. Crow I would fly to the U.K. in a heartbeat if it were an option), but I recognized how important it was to make this happen locally. I wrote a few e-mails pleading for help and demanding a direct rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To our neurologist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My sweet, joyful, smart, expressive, and clever little girl is dying. We will love however much of her body and mind remains, but we will have lost our daughter that we take so much pride in. I recognize that Auri&apos;s in need of a courageous doctor, I&apos;m asking you to be that person. For my daughter&apos;s sake, I can&apos;t stop trying; her salvation lies within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the chair of pediatrics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This questionable time frame [for restarting clinical trials] represents severe CNS organ damage for my child and severe physical and intellectual disability. By our account, she&apos;s cognitively on par with her peers right now. Without guarantees [...] and a time frame that has changed in the past, I&apos;m not willing to take this risk. Waiting is tantamount to abstaining from treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Aurelia has no acceptable options and continues to worsen. We&apos;re willing to do whatever possible and pay whatever it costs out of pocket to make this happen at Duke. The risks of not treating her far outweigh the risks inherent to anti-JAK therapy. I&apos;m guaranteed to lose my daughter in mind if not body. Can you help us make something happen?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Dr. K:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&apos;t spoken to her in a little over two weeks, when she had wished us luck after hearing that some preliminary genetic results were communicated to our doctor over the phone. I knew that her specialty wasn&apos;t really relevant to this, but I hoped that she might be able to advocate for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was hoping to appeal to your experience for some logistical and advocacy advice. I&apos;m sorry for the lengthy e-mail but I think context is important (it&apos;s rather rich now after two weeks). I&apos;ve poured myself into AGS research and made contact with a few of the right people. I feel like Auri is up against a logistical problem, not a medical one; and I&apos;m wondering if there&apos;s any advice or assistance you could provide. An effective therapy exists, but it&apos;s complicated, off-label, and we somehow need to motivate and inspire a handful of doctors at the same time to try something new. I really don&apos;t know how to present the context or what questions to ask you. Frankly, I&apos;m frustrated because this therapy could arrest Auri&apos;s CNS damage, but we have not secured any guarantee of treatment. I believe [our neurologist] is willing and eager but requires support from pediatric rheumatology at Duke. Do you have any ideas or influence that could make an IND or treatment at Duke happen quickly? Is this not the right thing to do; am I asking too much of everyone? Is an IND necessary given that we&apos;re willing and able to pay out of pocket?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] Thanks to WES, we have a rapid and early diagnosis for Auri, but I can&apos;t seem to secure her treatment. We&apos;re looking at a wait of many months with CHOP which could have profound consequences on her intellect and health. She stands to save so much if we could start now, and she continues to deteriorate. There&apos;s more genetic, biomolecular, and clinical AGS research than what I&apos;ve provided. [...] I have so much more to stay about this, but my research and efforts seem to hit a brick wall and I don&apos;t have a ladder. Would you be able to help me build one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She replied within twenty minutes, &quot;I’m in meetings until tonight.  I will study this and send back a reply later tonight or tomorrow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Fucking Miracle - February 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By nine in the morning on Saturday, February 9th, Dr. K had replied; and I&apos;m certain that reading this brought me to tears. It still does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Patrick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see no reason why one of these two anti JAK drugs couldn’t be tried.  I also think that Auri is going to need aggressive supportive care.  That will include a gastrostomy tube for feeding, hydration and medications, and possibly other interventions. You and her mom will also need to fully understand the side effects of these drugs so that you are not surprised if some of them occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot make this happen over the weekend, but I can ‘talk’ with the parties involved to figure out if we can make this happen at Duke or if we need to refer her to another institution to get the therapy.  I completely understand that Duke would be preferred and I will do whatever I can to make it happen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back in touch on and off over the weekend with updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just another moment in a serious of traumatic highs and lows that brought me to the edge of insanity over and over again. I&apos;ve wondered lately how I managed to keep from snapping, having placed so much pressure on myself. From my perspective, I was trying desperately to save my daughter&apos;s life from a couch with a computer. Natalie and I went to dinner with my Aunt that was visiting to help us. We managed to smile and make small talk, but only Maureen would remember how much we were really present. I think I was somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logistics - February 10th - 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few important things happened on Sunday. It was clear that Auri&apos;s situation had escalated over the weekend. The chair of pediatrics at Duke replied to me that she was personally reaching out to Dr. G, whom she had worked with in the past. She assured me, &quot;please know we do understand the urgency to get her the right care.&quot; I didn&apos;t understand the gravity of her involvement and &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; kept pushing. Natalie&apos;s sister pointed out how significant this development was, and even Dr. G expressed the same sentiment. I kept my mouth shut and simply said thank you. I was in a &lt;em&gt;panic&lt;/em&gt; at the dinner table, wondering what was happening and whether this was going to be a breakthrough. I didn&apos;t eat. I just paced in the dining room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening on Sunday, I also heard from another doctor elsewhere about the possibility of doing anti-JAK therapy. This felt like a backup plan, but I started signing authorization forms to send medical records and began a back and forth e-mail chain that kept me up until midnight. By the end of the weekend, we had arranged a clinic visit with Dr. K on Tuesday and were developing a promising lead. Monday was calm. I think I went to work, watched the clock, and hoped we would receive good news on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Success - February 12th&lt;/h3&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we got the green light and Dr. K was going to manage treatment. It took a minute for the news to come out, and we went into the appointment not sure of the decisions made over the weekend. Before getting the news, I expressed to Dr. K how grateful I was that she took up the cause and how &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; I felt in all of this. I had done whatever I felt I could, but continually reckoned with how little control I had over the outcome. I think she might have thought I already knew their decision, because I had to ask for clarification (&quot;does this mean you &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; going to do this?&quot;). When she said yes I put my head in my hands and broke down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; difficult time recalling pivotal moments like these without losing it. My daughter&apos;s future seemed to balance on so much outside of my control, but I wouldn&apos;t have been able to live with myself if I had failed. At some point in the previous week, Natalie had told me that she was proud of all the research and work I had performed. I appreciated her saying so, but I told her that none of it mattered unless we succeeded. While there were a few moments of uncertainty in the following days, there was nothing that put access to this treatment at risk. We had succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lennox's Birthday and Some Videos of Auri's Movement and Play]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Roller Coaster Ending With Improved Lab Tests It's been a stressful few weeks.

&lt;h3&gt;A Roller Coaster Ending With Improved Lab Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a stressful few weeks. On my birthday, April 9th, Auri had some disappointing lab results. Some of her white blood cell counts dropped significantly and her EBV viral count went up an order of magnitude. Her doctor assured us that there wasn&apos;t anything necessarily abnormal about what we were seeing. Auri had tested positive (at very low levels) for EBV in February, and she might still be working through it because the values weren&apos;t that high. Additionally, her cell counts were potentially related and she expected them to recover. Over the last few weeks, she hasn&apos;t been sleeping well and we expect another tooth. The tooth has yet to come but we can see the slit. And, she&apos;s been running a fever for the last couple of days, which adds to the stress. Last night was particularly miserable, but she&apos;s been happy during the day. When she cut her bottom teeth, we saw something similar. We just have our fingers crossed that we&apos;ll see a tooth soon and have a better few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piling on, on April 17th, our dog had &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; surgery to remove a large tumor. He&apos;s doing better now, but when I brought him home I panicked thinking I had made the wrong decision. He&apos;s been suffering knee trouble again and had a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; difficult time getting up for a day or two. Now on his feet again, he seems pretty happy and relatively normal. But, he has a &lt;em&gt;gruesome&lt;/em&gt; wound with twenty staples. For a few days I had to empty fluid draining from the cavity left by the removed tumor. I really wish that we didn&apos;t have to deal with this too, but I think we&apos;re past the worst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this past week we saw Auri&apos;s white blood cell counts recover and her EBV count go back to where it was before she started treatment. Additionally, we have another result showing &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; improvements in Auri&apos;s interferon scores. These scores indicate the activity of &quot;interferon stimulated genes,&quot; which are used to measure disease activity in AGS, CANDLE, and SAVI (among others) in a research setting. The numbers for AGS patients, I&apos;ve been told, can range between 50 and 500 during active disease; but I can&apos;t find the data to back it up. In what&apos;s published, it seems like there&apos;s &quot;a trend to higher levels in IFIH1,&quot; Auri&apos;s genotype. It&apos;s clear that her scores when we started treatment were &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; and indicated active disease. I hope that these reductions continue and that we see more stability to go with it. I think the most recent value puts Auri pretty close to normal and within the baseline they see in stable children with AGS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commentary: I think the &quot;AGS Pre-Treatment&quot; values seem low because the disease has this &quot;once and done&quot; kind of behavior. The samples would be from children that have already experienced their active and acute disease phase. In contrast, CANDLE and SAVI are chronic diseases that never let up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some Videos of Auri&apos;s Movement and Play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our bi-weekly followup with Auri&apos;s doctor this past Tuesday, we were asked some questions that made me realize how difficult it is for the doctor to gauge Auri&apos;s progress through pictures or short visits. I believe Dr. K. asked if Auri was capable of taking toys out of a box. Natalie and I were probably surprised that the question would be asked, but Auri does spend most of the office visit sitting in our lap and yelling. So, I asked if it would be helpful to share some videos. I sent her an e-mail (below) with a few videos from the past two weeks. And, I have one additional video to share from this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April 25th - In Her New Jumper - &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ryssLUsW11rYCLid8&quot;&gt;https://photos.app.goo.gl/ryssLUsW11rYCLid8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I have a lot of these little videos documenting Auri&apos;s progress. I should have offered confirmation today; yes, she&apos;s been improving, slowly. My anxiety has been about whether she can maintain this treatment, not about whether it has been working. I don&apos;t think she&apos;ll check any boxes for regained skills soon, but her strength has improved and she&apos;s headed in a positive direction. If we could bill insurance for all the hard work Natalie makes her perform, we&apos;d be millionaires. Auri is always moving, always working. Here are a few videos that answer some of your questions today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Lennox&apos;s Birthday Party&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had a small birthday party for Lennox. We invited just a couple of his friends over and played in the backyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, we&apos;ve established the expectation that we&apos;ll have a Piñata. &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/BwCqyjHeM25Gpbi29&quot;&gt;The kids love to beat the hell out of it&lt;/a&gt;, but they can never get it open themselves because we won&apos;t give them a metal rod. It felt nice (and normal) to have a little party. We&apos;ve been terribly stressed this month, and watching everyone have a good time helped dull the edge a little. We can&apos;t stop feeling stressed, but I feel like I can start to see normal on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dark Hallways - January 7th - January 8th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stumbled through the hospital trying to make it back to Natalie and Auri, I had to stop and compose myself multiple times. I kept fearing I was going to faint, and my knees were so weak that I kind of awkwardly fell through the hallways. On the verge of a breakdown, I spotted Natalie&apos;s sister in front of me and barely choked out her name. A somber hug and an almost run to the hospital room brought me to them unbearably slowly. Natalie sat on the bed, trying to keep Auri calm. It just didn&apos;t look much different than earlier that day, except that they were both exhausted. Auri had to be sedated for her MRI, and she had been poked and prodded and was not making anything easy. As tired as she might have been, both Natale and I knew that she wasn&apos;t going to sleep well that night. I had to say goodbye knowing that Natalie had the worst of it and wouldn&apos;t get any rest. Unfortunately, I don&apos;t remember much about that night. I can&apos;t remember how I got home or what I did when I got there. All I&apos;m certain of is that I took a few Tylenol PM because I did so every night for the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a restless night at home and the emotional difficulty of delivering Max and Lennox to school the next day, I found myself struggling through the halls of the hospital again. When I reached Auri&apos;s room, I found that she and Natalie had been taken to prep for a lumbar puncture to draw cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for testing. Two nurses offered to walk me to them, but I really needed a few more to carry me. I had to stop foor multiple panic attacks before finding Natalie in the procedure room, with Auri on a table about to get a needle in her spine. This was the last of tests before we demanded to leave. They&apos;d have what they needed to try and figure it out. We just wanted to go home. If I had no energy, I can&apos;t imagine how Natalie felt after two days in a hospital with an infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discharge - January 8th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On what I believe was the same day, Auri&apos;s neurologist spoke with us before discharge and read us that the MRI indicated &quot;abnormal white matter changes concerning for leukodystrophy of unknown etiology.&quot; In what was my first brush with seemingly paradoxical statements about Auri&apos;s health, she told us that it was a good catch by the resident radiologist because the abnormalities were subtle and hard to spot. It meant that we caught it early. Something about how that was phrased seemed absurd to me, but I still had at least one foot out the door and a toe dipped in denial. How could I accept what I was being told? I couldn&apos;t really process what was happening, and everything I was hearing was terrifying. As Natalie got Auri ready to leave, I spoke with the ER residents and attending about discharge instructions. It was another moment in a month of absurdities. As I sat in a chair in the hallway, they asked me if I understood what was happening and what our next steps were. I calmly explained that I understood that my daughter was dying, and that we were to keep her comfortable and enjoy whatever time with her that we had left. I can remember the pain in their faces and their uncertainty about how to end the conversation. As far as they knew, that was exactly what was happening. At least one looked like she wanted to give me a hug but she must have thought twice about it because they left with that sort of awkward, backward shuffle that people do when they want to get away from a difficult situation. One doctor lingered, but I felt so far from reality. I didn&apos;t want her sympathy. I left in a blur to pick up Max from school, relieved that Natalie was on my heels with Auri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maybe It&apos;s Nothing - January 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I kept telling myself. Everyone I spoke with tried to remind me to remain positive and hopeful. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I lied to myself. The day after we left the hospital, we actually took everyone to Dave and Buster&apos;s. I had been taking the boys there somewhat regularly as a treat for good behavior. Natalie and I wanted to do something as a family, and since Auri had never been, we thought it might be the perfect activity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the insanity of the previous few days, we found relief and had a lot of fun. I thought that if we could do stuff like this together, it might not be so bad. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s nothing,&quot; I thought again. Or, if it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; something, maybe it would turn out alright. If I allowed myself to think this was real, I had to acknowledge that either Max or Lennox stood a large chance of having the same thing happen to them. Most leukodystrophies are genetically recessive, and the math worked out to a 44% chance that one of them might have inherited the same thing. I couldn&apos;t face that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It Definitely Looks like Something - January 10th - January 15th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Eye Test - January 10th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were referred to follow up with a neuro-ophthalmologist to determine if Auri had any damage to her optic nerve that might help with a differential diagnosis. With a clap and a proclamation of &quot;good news&quot; she told us that Auri&apos;s optic nerve looked fine. It was &lt;em&gt;good news&lt;/em&gt; because damage might have been a sign of &quot;one of the bad ones,&quot; she was referring to leukodystrophies. That struck me in such an awkwardly painful way that I stared to tear up. &quot;Is there a good leukodystrophy?&quot; I wondered. &quot;Are you okay, sir?&quot; she asked and actually handed me a lollipop. &quot;Am I okay?&quot; It was such a strange thought to think that there was good news, or that she had just given me some. It was what I came to understand (and later describe) as a relativism that continued and grew stranger with every appointment. However, the lollipop did make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the waiting room, Auri was &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/bWVydTzLdPVCQdFc6&quot;&gt;eating a banana&lt;/a&gt; and playing with toys. She was sitting up in Natalie&apos;s lap. I couldn&apos;t make sense of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reaching Out - January 11th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, on Friday, January 11th, I sent an e-mail to Dr. K about her &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02254863&quot;&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; introducing umbilical cord blood as an advance and adjunctive therapy to bone marrow transplantation. I had hoped that we could get Auri prepared for whatever might be necessary by finding the right contact. A portion of what I wrote her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If we receive confirmation that Auri is experiencing the onset of a late infantile leukodystrophy, I would like to be in a position to offer her options. I&apos;m sure you know that the rate of progression of these diseases in infants can make HSCT inadvisable, and I&apos;m hopeful that your trial may provide an avenue for treatment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Meeting Dr. K - January 15th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, Dr K. replied over the weekend and asked to take a look at Auri&apos;s case. By the end of Saturday, she had scheduled us to meet in clinic the following week. On Tuesday, the 15th, we drew some blood samples to do HLA typing (to find a donor match). From what I remember as an afterthought, she suggested we order Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). The results of some of the blood and spinal fluid tests had already ruled out some of the more common leukodystrophies, and Dr. K. said something to the effect of &quot;whatever this is, WES will tell us faster than anything else.&quot; She and her team were to see about getting it rushed. This meeting and that decision proved to be &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to our story. At the time, I worried that Dr. K wouldn&apos;t be able to help us. I asked her what would exclude Auri from bone marrow transplantation as a treatment. She told me that it can take up to six months before it has an effect, and that further regression and increased spasticity would rule it out. My understanding of how fast leukodystrophies progress meant that even if the treatment proved to be an option, Auri might not survive long enough or be in a good enough condition to make it advisable. With tremendous difficulty, I asked her point blank if she thought this was a leukodystrophy. She didn&apos;t mince words. In her opinion and experience, it &lt;em&gt;looked classically so&lt;/em&gt;. Confusingly, the nurses and aides in the room kept remarking to each other how remarkable it was that Auri still had &quot;so much function.&quot; They seemed genuinely surprised to see a child with what appeared to be such an early and rapid diagnosis. This gave me some hope, but it also made me begin to wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What&apos;s Actually Going On? - January 16th - January 24th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, we were over a week into this tragedy and the stress had already taken its toll. I don&apos;t remember eating anything but a handful of crackers and a lollipop after checking Auri into the hospital. I weighed myself, and I had lost over ten pounds. When I shared this with Natalie, she had lost the same. Between us, we weren&apos;t sleeping or eating; and I hadn&apos;t shown up for work in over a week. I wish I could say that this was my lowest point in this story, but it continued to get worse. We still tried to maintain composure and do things like meet Max at his elementary school for lunch and go to the park or kid&apos;s museum.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 20th, Auri was clearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/1b6H3dnPpzMUzDAh6&quot;&gt;struggling to crawl&lt;/a&gt;, but the changes still seemed slow. I don&apos;t have a picture or video of it, but Natalie remembers January 23rd as the last day she was able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow-Up with Neurology - January 17th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after entering the hospital, we had a follow up with our neurologist that gave us more questions than answers. The comprehensive set of CSF and blood tests were inconclusive. Mostly, they ruled things out. It was unclear what to try next. So, if I remember correctly, the doctor said that we were going to go &quot;old school,&quot; and tests for things, however unlikely, that might be immediately treatable. This included checking for (among others) vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal poisoning, and thyroid problems. To me, it seemed like Auri might have avoided the really terrible diseases; and I hoped that there was a simpler explanation. I &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; remember examining the concentration of zinc in her diaper rash cream and researching the levels need to induce toxicity. What an outrageously naive thing to think, but we had no idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Research and Attempts to Contact Help - January 18th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I began contacting others. I had a particular fear of Vanishing White Matter disease, and I tried writing a handful of clinical researchers to get advice. Even though I wasn&apos;t getting any responses, I didn&apos;t really have any other idea what to do. I was grasping at straws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;My investigations have demonstrated that you&apos;re at the forefront of research into white matter disorders, in particular the role of astrocyte dysfunction in vanishing white matter disease. I&apos;m writing you in request of information about possible experiments into glial stem cell therapies or any other potential treatments for this disease. I&apos;m under the impression that experiments are only being done on mouse models right now, but I was hoping that you may know better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I was at least practicing my communication skills. I had written so many e-mails about Auri&apos;s condition that I had a template that read like a medical summary. In the weeks to come, I think that practice helped me to demonstrate, when it counted, that I had a reasonable grasp on what I was asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It Wasn&apos;t Adding Up - January 18th - 24th&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something didn&apos;t quite add up for me at this point. I had read about leukodystrophies, and so many of them moved terrifyingly quickly. While Auri had lost skills and was struggling, she was still &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of hanging on to things. On January 20th, she was still crawling a little and getting into a kneeling position to play.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a leukodystrophy, this didn&apos;t seem to add up. I began to wonder if there was something else going wrong. It was still possible that something fixable was occurring. Auri was still trying to do so much. We tried to spend time together as a family, and we had some visitors. I kept reading about leukodystrophies and sent a number of questions to our neurologist. In one e-mail on January 22nd, I &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; hit on the idea that the brain damage we were witnessing was secondary to some other process. In a roundabout way, it turned out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Could inflammation markers (sedimentation rate and vWF antigen) indicate inflammation in the MRI as a secondary effect of some metabolic disorder rather than a primarily demyelinating disease? I&apos;ve been trying my hardest to research and follow along, and I&apos;m curious if you think it could be helpful to consult with any other specialists. I&apos;m under the impression that Auri&apos;s case may be unfolding in a unique way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WES Report - January 24th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary genetic report was made available to our neurologist relatively soon after we sent for it. It had taken less than two weeks from our appointment with Dr. K. I knew when the results were available because I had been in contact with the laboratory, but when I tried to get information from our doctor, she requested that we meet her the following day. Obviously, I couldn&apos;t sleep that night. I was &lt;em&gt;pissed&lt;/em&gt; then and now that we were made to wait, but I think our doctor needed the time to do research. Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is rare, and I can&apos;t imagine she felt comfortable discussing it with us without having time to figure out what it meant and what our options were. When we finally did meet, it was clear that there really weren&apos;t any. But I was handed a few research articles that I devoured on the way home that gave me some hope. There was at least one clinical trial that had been run for a few years, and researchers had speculated in the past about treatments and favorable outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Observations about the natural history of AGS] are important because they suggest that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treatment in the early stages of the disease might result in attenuation of the associated inflammation and consequent tissue damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might be possible to discontinue treatments after the subacute encephalopathic period subsides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898548/&quot;&gt;&quot;Therapies in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome&quot;&lt;/a&gt; Y J Crow, A Vanderver, S Orcesi, T W Kuijpers, and G I Rice. 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we were made aware of a clinical research trial in Philadelphia that had just closed. We planned to contact the Children&apos;s Hospital there (CHOP) as soon as possible and see if they could provide any recommendations or assistance. We were to meet back with our neurologist in no longer than two weeks to build a plan and discuss what she could dig up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was devastated. There&apos;s no pretending otherwise. But, I had &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to direct my energy towards. I had been given a name of what I knew only as fear. It was a relief in some ways, another paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I remember that I didn&apos;t add in the first pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Pizoli said that we were looking at a &quot;formidable foe&quot; when she reviewed the MRI with us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I watched all five Jim Gaffigan specials, one each night. I remember being really grateful to find something that helped me relax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My dad and mother-in-law came to visit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One day we went somewhere with the kids to meet their cousins. I put on Lady Gaga in the car thinking it would lift our sprits. Imagine hearing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ll04Zzw5UM&quot;&gt;Joanne&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve never held Natalie&apos;s hand so tightly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For posterity, I&apos;ve tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mostly Normal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t recall when it started, but Natalie and I have had concerns about Auri for a long time. I think we always felt sensitive about how differently she developed from her brothers. If Max and Lennox had learned something early, Auri had learned it a month or two later. She always gained skills just in time, before it seemed prudent to have concerns. If we brought it up, somebody would remind us that &quot;girls are just different.&quot; They might have been right. We&apos;ll never know. It&apos;s unclear whether she experienced disease related issues at an early age, and if she had, they weren&apos;t severe enough to notice. However, Natalie had directly voiced concerns about Auri&apos;s developmental to a friend as early as October. If none of this ever happened, we would probably just be telling people, &quot;every kid is different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Up - November 13th - December 22nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, something felt different around her first birthday. Auri had been pulling up, but not really scooting. She stood on one of her ankles funny, and Natalie and I discussed bringing it up at her one year checkup with the pediatrician. Coincidentally, at that appointment in the middle of November our doctor shared that she scored low on a parent questionnaire about her gross motor development. In fact, she &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; it. It was concerning, but we were assured that it happens sometimes. Given that everything else seemed to be continuing alright, we left hoping that it might be a fluke. We had given voice to our concerns, at least; and the pediatrician assured us that she sees more false positives than genuine issues with these questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, tensions seemed to be really high in our marriage. In retrospect,  I think we were registering that something wasn&apos;t going well. At the time, I felt like Natalie and I weren&apos;t on the same page. Auri was constantly complaining to be picked up, and we must have had a hundred arguments about training her to be more independent. After a year of doing everything for a baby, I know that we were both hoping that things would get easier. Auri could and would crawl to play by herself,  but I think that she started demanding more of us. We didn&apos;t realize that she was beginning to struggle. Though she was crawling and sitting up on her knees, I can&apos;t remember seeing her sit up on her butt. On her first birthday, though, she was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more stress to this period, I was in the process of switching jobs. Throughout the summer and fall, I had been working through a great deal of frustration with my employer. I had been given too much responsibility, too few resources, and high expectations. When I successfully delivered despite these difficulties, I didn&apos;t receive any recognition. I resolved to leave in October, and started my new position just before Thanksgiving. All of this, and my prior over-focus on work, added fuel to the fire. Natalie, on the other hand, was caring for two children at home. She must have been hoping for Lennox and Auri to start playing together. Unfortunately, they just didn&apos;t seem to jive. Lennox didn&apos;t want to play with a baby; he had a much more interesting older brother. Natalie was stressed and she started painting. We were both subconsciously trying to address some dissatisfaction that we were experiencing at home, but we never gave it a name  or a shape. We just felt frustrated. In December, Auri was standing and nothing seemed wrong. We hoped it would continue to get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Event - December 23rd - December 25th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before Christmas, on December 23rd, Auri woke up with a reasonably high fever (I think it was &gt; 102F). She had slept through the night, but we could tell she wasn&apos;t feeling well. I sat in bed that morning and played her some music. She sat patiently, but looked distracted and disinterested. I remember being surprised that she wasn&apos;t more thrilled. She had always danced and really enjoyed music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christmas morning, we all fell ill. It was a subdued morning, and Natalie and I probably just phoned it in a bit. The kids were excited, but even they lacked a whole lot of enthusiasm. I remember feeling &lt;em&gt;drained&lt;/em&gt;, and you can see it in this picture of Auri. We didn&apos;t know it at the time, but we now think this illness precipitated what came next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Not Right - December 26th - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we visited friends that have a daughter close in age to Auri. I remember feeling like something was wrong, but not knowing how acute it was until seeing their daughter (a few months older) run around and chase the boys. Auri could barely crawl around and play with toys. Something wasn&apos;t right, and Natalie and I both knew it. By the week of January 1st, we felt like something was seriously wrong and we had to take action. Natalie phoned our pediatrician and asked for an immediate followup. During the visit, Auri weighed in at &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same weight that she had been a month and a half prior, and her &quot;slowness&quot; as the doctor described it prompted a call to Duke pediatric neurology for advice. The neurologist on call &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommended we bring her to the emergency room to expedite testing. A normal appointment and consultation might take weeks. We really weren&apos;t sure what to do, nor did we have any idea how serious it was. On Saturday night, Natalie and I went rollerskating on a date. We had a good time and didn&apos;t talk about Auri much. We didn&apos;t think it could be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; serious, and we were trying to turn a corner and focus on being more positive together and at home. This is the last time I can remember feeling care free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we wrestled with the idea of waiting to make an appointment. But after reviewing old pictures and videos that night, we realized that what had thought was some kind of developmental delay had unequivocally become developmental regression. We had been so focused on Auri&apos;s standing and attempts at walking that we completely missed her struggling to crawl and sit up. We made plans to take her first thing Monday morning, and I drafted notes to provide to the doctors with dates, milestones, and gained and lost skills. At this point, she could barely sit up and we hadn&apos;t really acknowledged how drastic her changes had been. In August, she was crawling around and sitting to play with her cousins at the beach. So much had changed so fast. Sunday night I tried to take a video of her sitting up, but she just fell over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Emergency Room Visit - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie hopped in the van with Auri just as soon as she woke up Monday morning and rushed to Duke. I had to take Max to school, and since Lennox was off from preschool, I took him with me to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed felt somewhat like a blur to me. I had fears that Auri might be suffering muscular dystrophy, and I kept asking about certain tests. I was so terrified that she would have a degenerative disease, but the markers I was concerned about came back normal. We didn&apos;t get any answers that morning, and I was forced to leave Natalie behind and head home to pick up Max. Still at the hospital, Natalie had to manage entertaining an infant through all the commotion. Without remembering the exact details of what happened, I know that they scheduled her for an MRI and a lot of blood work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t remember who helped put Max and Lennox to bed that night (it might have been Dan), but  after getting them ready, I hopped back into the car to drive to the hospital. On the way, Natalie sent me a &quot;where are you, hurry up&quot; kind of message. I just knew it meant she had something to share and I called her back. Somehow, one of the residents had committed a faux pas and read Natalie an excerpt of the preliminary MRI report. Natalie told me that they thought it was a leukodystrophy. I didn&apos;t know what that meant, and I almost crashed my car after looking it up while on the highway. I started hyperventilating and everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Week in the Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[With this update, I'd like to give everyone a sense of our weekly experience.

We have a lot of regular appointments with doctors and therapists, but right now they&apos;re largely focused on long term management. I believe that we&apos;re transitioning from an acute period of tests and diagnostics into a treatment plan that&apos;s looking optimistically forward. Behind us are ultrasounds of the heart and kidneys, hip x-rays, broad screening for viral illnesses, and a host of other tests that Auri passed without concern. Moving forward, we&apos;re focusing on monitoring changes from the drug she&apos;s taking and lots of therapy. In my opinion, the drug is working and Auri&apos;s in a category of moderate AGS severity. Relatively speaking, she&apos;s incredibly lucky to have a chance at mostly normal development. We&apos;re working on helping her catch back up. Again, I have to add the caveat that the doctors and scientists involved refuse to declare success, but that&apos;s because they need irrefutable evidence from more patients. For now, we simply need to make sure that she&apos;s at a safe dose and stays healthy. In good news, Cigna accepted our appeal and will be covering Auri&apos;s medication. I&apos;m sure that we would have found a way to keep going, but this will remove an extremely large financial burdern (at least $4k a month). Now, we&apos;re looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 30 days, we&apos;ve begun a comprehensive therapy program for Auri. She receives support from the state of &lt;a href=&quot;https://beearly.nc.gov/&quot;&gt;North Carolina&apos;s Infant Toddler Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program has helped us coordinate and schedule a number of different kinds of therapists to ensure that she&apos;s getting the opportunity to rebuild and regain skills. She most recently had an assessment by a speech therapist, which I&apos;ll go into further below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physical Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a week for an hour, a physical therapist comes to our home and works with Auri on gross motor development. Since she received her Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFOs), we&apos;ve been working on bearing weight on her legs and feet while standing and building strength in her core.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri&apos;s therapist will help her stand, make her reach across her body, etc. We tend to place her sitting on her heels, and let her play with toys at a raised cushion. We&apos;ve seen Auri redevelop  a lot of lost strength in her abdomen this way. Compared to a month ago, Auri&apos;s getting muscular. She might not have strong balance or coordination, but I&apos;ve definitely noticed and can feel a lot more muscle around her sides, back, and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feeding Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a week for thirty minutes, Natalie takes Auri to either Duke hospital or Duke&apos;s location in Brier Creek to work with a feeding therapist. They spend about a half an hour trying different foods, and more importantly, introducing different thicknesses of fluids and water. Our current goal with the therapist is to find the safest and most effective way to ensure that Auri is getting hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri recently had a video fluoroscopic swallowing exam done that uses an X-Ray machine to watch her swallow foods and liquids. She performed well, demonstrating a small amount of swallow fatigue. But, she manages food well and handles thicker liquids without aspirating. The report&apos;s prognosis was promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Prognosis: Fair for improved function with skilled speech pathology services focusing on stated goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Auri&apos;s occupational therapist, we work on development of fine motor skills. Once a week, and also in home, her therapist plays with her stacking blocks, passing things between her hands, etc. The therapist has boxes with little toys that she tries to get Auri to use both hands with. She has her press with her fingers on buttons and use toys that require her to  push hard with her hand. The goal here is to help her improve her hand coordination. Auri started to lose some skills with her fingers that she&apos;s been slowly regaining. At her worst, she began closing her hands and reaching for things in a closed fist or claw like manner. Since then, she&apos;s begun using open hands again and can help feed herself yogurt with a spoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speech Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New this week, we&apos;ve started Auri with a speech therapist. Although we haven&apos;t yet scheduled  these, the therapist is recommending twice a week, thirty minute appointments. I believe that this therapy will focus on helping Auri with expressive gestures and language. She&apos;ll be doing things like  making animal noises to build speech skills. The evaluation involved a big checklist of questions like, &quot;does she look at Dad when you say his name?&quot; The answers to the questions produce scores split by &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt; understanding and &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; use of speech and expression. Considering the circumstances, I&apos;m happy with how Auri performed. She&apos;s within the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt;, meaning she understands language and speech. And, she&apos;s just below the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; expression, meaning she&apos;s a little behind on developing sounds and gestures. I&apos;m not surprised that she has challenges, considering she&apos;s lost a couple of months of normal development. I&apos;m a little sad about this, but in the grand scheme of things it means we caught (and hopefully stopped) this disease before it claimed her intellectually. Before these changes, Auri was wickedly smart and expressive. I don&apos;t believe she&apos;s lost that, but it makes me wonder where she might be now had she the opportunity to run around and explore. Still, this is &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; news, and she will probably gain a lot from this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Ups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday, we take Auri to Duke to see Dr. K. At these appointments, they do a handful of blood tests and send a sample off for research. Right now, we&apos;re watching things like red and white blood cell counts, kidney and liver enzymes, and for signs of unexpected infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, things have been going well. I&apos;ve been watching slow changes in some of these values, but there has not been anything drastic. It&apos;s possible that they all settle where they are soon and we sit at the current medication dosage. At some point, probably after another few months, these follow ups will become fewer and farther between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like we&apos;ve really struggled here. We used to go out to dinner regularly as a family, meet up with friends, and spend more time together. Recently, we bought a portable chair that should provide Auri with enough support to sit anywhere we take her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out last night. Max had been asking for Sushi. It was a success! We had been waiting for this to make it through customs for about a month, and I&apos;m glad that it finally arrived. Since Auri can&apos;t sit in a high chair, it&apos;s been difficult for us to go places. Now I think we&apos;ll have more freedom and can get out of the house together more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Health Care, Equipment, Care Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in general, our deep dive into the health care system has been frustrating. We have a lot of bills coming in, some with mistakes. We&apos;ve also had to work through exclusive equipment providers to order some things like a pediatric stroller/wheelchair and a standing table. Over the past few weeks we&apos;ve had Auri measured for equipment and orthoses. For whatever reason, this process seems designed to make it both difficult and lengthy. I have a few tasks on my checklist to follow up and work some of this stuff out. Hopefully, Auri will get some helpful things soon. Next week we&apos;re fitting her for a support vest that should help her with core strength and coordination. We just recently bought this contraption, that lets Auri walk around this us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a few conversations scheduled to talk with different people about different foundations, services, and other financial support options that might be available to us. I believe that Auri will qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits from the Social Security Administration, and she will likely qualify for Medicaid to help pay co-pays and co-insurance. Right now, the financial cost of this isn&apos;t big on my list of concerns, but going forward we may need to do things like expand our house or renovate for accessibility. I&apos;ll be speaking with a lawyer next week about the possibility of opening a special needs trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day by Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, between Natalie and I, we juggle getting Max and Lennox ready and delivered to kindergarten and pre-school. The morning involves breakfast, dissolving and delivering Auri&apos;s medicine, dressing, brushing, packing lunches, etc. It&apos;s usually a bit of a dash, but they get there. There&apos;s almost always a therapy appointment of some kind before lunch, and then Natalie&apos;s feeding one or two kids before naptime. I&apos;m at home a day or two a week, but Natalie&apos;s usually managing this chaos on her own. When she&apos;s awake, Auri just wants to walk around endlessly. Right now that involves Natalie having to bend over and hold Auri up while she takes small steps around. If she takes a good nap, Natalie gets a little break before doing the same thing in the afternoon. It always feels a little crazy when I walk in the door, because the energy in the house with Max and Lennox can get a little much. It&apos;s been difficult to make everyone happy, so there&apos;s usually some argument about dinner, shower, etc. We&apos;re making it through, but I know that Natalie and I are both exhausted when everyone finally hits their bed. If we&apos;re lucky, and we aren&apos;t always, Auri will sleep through the night and we get a good rest. In the past couple of weeks, though, we&apos;ve had wet beds, vomiting, diarrhea, croupe, and some bad nights with everyone. Our boys have been sick with one thing or another, and Auri has been teething and acting restless. We&apos;re guessing that she&apos;s both learning a lot and dealing with a sore mouth, so she doesn&apos;t always sleep the best. We kind of take things day by day and it feels like a coin toss whether we&apos;ll get an easy or a hard one. It&apos;s starting to feel a little more like it did before all of this happened, though. Raising three children six and under isn&apos;t without its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren&apos;t easy, by any stretch of the imagination. But Natalie recalled recently that Dr. K reminded us that &quot;it could be much worse.&quot; I think that&apos;s probably the best way to  describe all of this and the ambivalence that we feel. Nobody wants something like this to happen to their child, but I follow the AGS family group on Facebook and it&apos;s really sad. For every child in Auri&apos;s condition or better, there&apos;s one or two that are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse. Without pulling together this treatment for Auri, I&apos;m certain she would have been in the &lt;em&gt;much worse&lt;/em&gt; category by now. I have so much empathy for those children and families, and it makes me grateful for where we are and the trends we&apos;re seeing. I think I might write another post soon detailing how we got here. This opportunity for Auri is truly remarkable and unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and caring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anxiety]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my past and with mixed success, I've fought my tendency to withdraw.

A good friend once described me as &quot;insular,&quot; and, admittedly, I&apos;m an introvert that prefers the predictability and control of my privacy. For over two months, unfortunately, that space has been a veritable nightmare: dreadful, unpredictable, and painful. Thus far I&apos;ve resisted the urge to engage in self pity, trying, rather, to focus on exhausting options for saving my daughter. But what left is there for me to do and how am I to feel now? Where do I direct my attention and from what well can I draw strength? We&apos;re alone, committed to an obscured path; and there&apos;s nothing more we can do. We move through the dark, in hope of protecting our daughter from further harm, a journey without a destination. Consequently, my personal space has been transformed into an enduring emotional struggle; and I&apos;m tired. Yet I&apos;ve been forced to come to terms these past two weeks with the insecurity that plagues our family now and forever. And, the feeling of being &lt;em&gt;apart&lt;/em&gt; has built tremendously since my last update. How do I answer a polite question like &quot;how are you today?&quot; Can I share how I really feel? Should I? With every friend, coworker, and family member, I&apos;m forced to politely withold. Is this real stoicism? The truth is too difficult. This must be why support groups exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why I&apos;m writing like this now, when I&apos;ve mostly stuck to the facts in my other updates. Well, I get asked often how Natalie and I are doing. I don&apos;t speak for Natalie. Even though I know she can relate to much of what I&apos;m sharing, still, I&apos;m never confident that I can really answer the question on her behalf. I can&apos;t even answer it on mine. Without exaggerating, I can tell you that my feelings change every hour. I swing between grief, fear, gratitude, and hope: grief for my daughter and the changes in our lives, fear that it may still get worse, gratitude for her remarkable opportunity, and hope that she can achieve a semi-normal life. As I watch Auri fluctuate, through colds, infections, and fatigue, I reckon with all of this and swing back and forth, sometimes within intervals of a few minutes. Imagine living on a world that experienced earthquakes with the same period. You&apos;d be in a state of constant panic. How would you deal? Could you go on a date and keep from crying in public? We can&apos;t, but we can still smile for a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is, my best answer to the &quot;how are you&quot; question. I&apos;m sure that some can relate, and I don&apos;t think we&apos;re unique. But most can&apos;t. When this all started I just tried to help everyone understand that it was better to say nothing. Trying to find the right thing to say or trying to empathize with an incomparable experience just kind of hurt more. I think that remains true. The depth of this, the biggest and most difficult experience of my life (past, present, and future), can&apos;t be communicated and will remain largely unspoken of. I&apos;m grateful that I have a partner who can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn&apos;t subscribe to hear me complain. You want to know how Auri&apos;s been doing since my last update. Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t answer the question with any confidence until yesterday. Since March 9th, Auri has been stuggling with an eye infection, on and off low-grade fevers, and the eruption of her first two teeth. She hasn&apos;t slept well or predictably, has been weak and tired, hasn&apos;t eaten or nursed well, and has had us all sorts of worried. Despite all of this, I had been communicating my belief that it was temporary, a consequence of infection or teething; but, to be honest, I&apos;m not sure what portion of that belief was just hope. We wrestled with a lot of doubt this week. Fortunately, the belief doesn&apos;t appear to have been misplaced and Auri really seems to be back on track. As before, the rails are being laid as we travel, and I can&apos;t dismiss the likelihood of future derailments. In fact, I fear another cold is on the horizon (from some sneezing and coughing). There&apos;s no rest for the weary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good news, here&apos;s Auri &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/E99jfQ5vXCreiUJTA&quot;&gt;taking some cautious sips of thickened water&lt;/a&gt; today. We&apos;ve been unsuccessfully trying to find a way to increase her fluid intake. She&apos;s been refusing everything we&apos;ve tried until yesterday. With this cup and to build her confidence, we&apos;re letting her take small sips of thickened water. Of course, this comes with her recovery this weekend and wouldn&apos;t have been reasonable last week. Nonetheless, there were a few moments between the sickly naps and crying that had me thinking she was still avoiding the progression of her disease. She&apos;s been playing the &quot;how big is Auri? So big!&quot; game with Natalie, lifting her arms above her head (so long as she&apos;s laying down). After work one evening, we laid on our backs and I held up a children&apos;s tablet for her to play with. She was passing the stylus between her hands and clearly enjoying scratching pictures on the screen. I haven&apos;t observed any neurological changes, and she&apos;s still feeling much better than she was at her lowest. Also, she really likes nutella...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote to appeal our insurance company&apos;s denial of her medication. My letter cited all the relevant research, and I provided a folder of about fifteen articles from various journals. One of these days I&apos;ll write about how we leveraged this research to get her treatment, but right now I&apos;m hoping it suits this purpose. I burned a whole cartridge of ink and delivered over a hundred pages after Cigna determined, &quot;with the information they had,&quot; that Auri&apos;s condition &quot;does not involve an imminent and serious threat to the health of the member.&quot; They&apos;ve denied the medication on the basis that there isn&apos;t enough evidence for its use. I&apos;m really not sure what the outcome will be, but I&apos;ve tried my best. The price of her medication wouldn&apos;t just bankrupt us, it would make the treatment impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got some data this week. Auri&apos;s lab results provide molecular confirmation of an intereferonopathy. Between her first sample (before medication) and ten days after beginning baricitinib, expression of her interferon stimulated genes reduced significantly. I had hoped for results from her third sample before claiming anything definitive, but the initial data is encouraging. We&apos;ll need to see more samples, given that these levels would be expected to fluctuate during illnesses. I suspect that we&apos;ll see a positive trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Trip to Philadelphia to Gather More Information]]></title><description><![CDATA[Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She&apos;s leading research and treatment of AGS in the U.S. and had lot of information and observations to relate about both Auri&apos;s disease and medication. I left a little disheartened by our conversation, but not because of anything we&apos;re doing or currently witnessing. It&apos;s just undeniable that Auri&apos;s disease will be lifelong and difficult. Thankfully though, there&apos;s every reason to believe that what we&apos;re doing for her now will be extremely advantageous to her quality of life. Although nobody will outright say it, the medication she&apos;s taking is presumed to be successful at stopping neurological regression and encouraging for managing her future struggle with secondary complications. Consequently, Natalie and I remain hopeful but will forever be in a state of fear that the next setback lies around the corner. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re going to handle that constant stress, and I worry about the consequences for Max and Lennox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for both of my parents this week. My mother watched Max and Lennox back home while we were gone, and my father met us in Philadelphia to chauffer and provide support. Sometimes it feels like we can barely handle ourselves and Auri, let alone two older boys and two dogs (one with cancer no less). Every moment that somebody entertains our kids and gives us a chance to decompress helps tremendously. I&apos;m looking forward to a visit by my cousin and her girls, and similarly thankful for my aunt&apos;s visit a couple of weeks a go. We need distractions because whenever I&apos;m sitting still I&apos;m worried. At any moment, Auri could start slipping through our fingers again; and she&apos;s struggling so hard to hold herself together. I&apos;m finding it impossible to not obsess about every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Cold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri&apos;s turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, but despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven&apos;t appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn&apos;t fully cleared up, she&apos;s pretty much back to normal sleep and I&apos;m hopeful that the worst has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we&apos;re panicking. We &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt; that Auri makes it through this and future illnesses without difficulty because any could trigger a disease flare. In a way, I feel like we&apos;re treading open water, one storm and big wave away from going under. Although she&apos;s still able to eat solids and drink pureed fruits and yogurt, Auri can&apos;t swallow plain water. Any further loss of feeding ability or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we&apos;re desperately trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and continued health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week. Unfortunately, with two toddlers in school, there&apos;s not a whole lot we can do to keep her away from bugs and germs while she regains her strength. We nervously wait, watch, and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes from CHOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country&apos;s  (and probably the world&apos;s) experts in AGS. They&apos;re also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we&apos;ve managed to get prescribed locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Dr. Vanderver related the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become more available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Based on a quick assessment, Dr. Vanderver guessed that Auri may suffer a &quot;moderate&quot; disease course (or somewhere in the middle of the disease spectrum), but I have my doubts about this based on the frightening slide that we witnessed in February. The team at CHOP thought that we might have disrupted the disease somewhere in the middle of a regressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri&apos;s life. Her risk of neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything definitive. Allowing for conjecture based on limited observations, we can hope that CHOP&apos;s three-year monitoring of patients on this drug suggests a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver shared that they have not seen a patient&apos;s neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats; most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure. We can&apos;t say that the drug is working nor can we treat it like a magic bullet. We received a sobering list of things to watch for, both drug and disease related, that underscore the seriousness of what we&apos;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&apos;ve left with encouraging news. They&apos;ve treated a child as young as two months of age that has appeared to benefit. Relatively speaking, there haven&apos;t been any significant, adverse drug induced events for the children they&apos;re treating. And, they have had children successfully on this drug for multiple years. Considering that CHOP continues to prescribe and research this medication for these children, we can assume that there&apos;s a reasonable benefit to the patients. Our uncertainty about whether we are seeing improvements so quickly has also been resolved. I&apos;d read this previously, but Dr. Vanderver confirmed that the drug &quot;works immediately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that continues to support us. For now, we believe that things are still going well and moving in a positive direction. Auri&apos;s much happier than she was before we started her medication and she continues to put on weight and slowly improve. We&apos;re in the process of ordering assistive equipment (like a supportive chair, standing table, and stroller) that should make things a little easier on us. We&apos;re all adjusting and trying to experience each day with grace and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, this week has put to rest however worried I&apos;ve been about inflating Auri&apos;s progress. Of course, I just can&apos;t continue without adding that there&apos;s a long way to go and a lot of unknowns. But, with that said, I&apos;d like to share that others have confirmed our observations and remarked on Auri&apos;s improvement. On Tuesday and Thursday, we&apos;ve had followups with Auri&apos;s doctor managing treatment and her neurologist, respectively. Both have said that she&apos;s doing notably better than when they had last seen her. For our neurologist, it has been over a month, during which Auri had gotten much, much worse. This indicates a really strong bounce back that has been, to me, literally unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago and only just after starting her medicine, Auri was feeling better but &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA&quot;&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she&apos;s progressively engaging her core muscles more and holding her body and head up better. Day by day we see continued improvement and I try to take notes of anything new. This past week, Auri has been extending her arms more and reaching over her head, dancing, and bouncing in the tub to make waves. These are little things, but they represent a strengthening of her core and neck muscles that had gotten much harder for her to control. Although she&apos;s not crawling yet, she has tried to get her knees up and pull herself forward in an army crawl. All this is happening for a girl that had two weeks ago largely stopped moving or twisting while on her back. I&apos;ve even caught her waking up from a nap &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; doing happy baby pose (on her back reaching out toward her pulled in feet). And, she&apos;s gained almost a pound (13 oz) in about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These small improvements continue to stack, in defiance of my reticence to celebrate them. Given how much we&apos;ve been grieving, I needed an expert to weight in before I could believe it. I can&apos;t really describe how much better we&apos;re all feeling, so if a picture is worth a thousand words, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/LxwLZ8MeyRvv7txQA&quot;&gt;a video is worth a million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Auri and Hope, Into the Unknown]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having started Auri's drug therapy, we're inching into the unknown, still carrying the fear that has caused us indescribable grief.

However, this week has brought us hope, something we haven&apos;t felt in what feels like an eternity. Last month I was certain we were losing our girl, but a spectrum of possibilities is opening before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re cautiously watching Auri feel better and get a little stronger. I would never have believed it if you had told me that I would be celebrating my daughter simply lifting her head up, but a picture from Natalie of her sitting up in a grocery cart brought me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the little things right now that both encourage and terrify me. Before we began this therapy, every day since December had been worse than the one before it. Since Saturday, February 16th, every day has been better. Is it too soon to celebrate? Of course. But, am I scrutinizing every moment? Of course. Something is happening, but it will be much longer before we know exactly what, why, and whether it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confounding Factors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, Natalie and I believe that we&apos;ve observed improvement after Auri has had blood taken for lab tests. At first we thought we were making it up, but now that we understand her disease better it seems plausible. When she loses blood, the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I&quot;&gt;interferon cytokines&lt;/a&gt; in her system would be temporarily reduced. Both on Tuesday and Thursday before starting her drug, she gave a large amount of blood to screen for viruses and other signs of infection. Additionally, children with AGS sometimes suffer flares when they get sick. The primary cause of this disease involves the immune system chaotically signaling viral infection where there is none. A simple cold could make things worse, and the week before starting this drug Auri had a bad one. Her cold had just started to break as we started the drug, and we&apos;d expect that alone to make her feel better. We&apos;ve seen that effect before, but her temporary improvement has never been as strong as we&apos;re seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting on Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, we still don&apos;t have any data on Auri&apos;s interferon levels. It might tell us something about the severity of her disease and how it was progressing. Until we receive a few data points showing a reduction in her body&apos;s response to the disease, it&apos;s impossible for us to even confirm AGS let alone efficacy of the drug she&apos;s taking. Frankly, we got started in haste. She was getting worse every day and there simply was not time to waste. Though we still don&apos;t have all the details, the diagnosis is pretty certain. In the coming weeks, we&apos;re hoping to get data demonstrating beyond a doubt that we&apos;re observing measurable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve gotten some questions about the drug that I can answer. It&apos;s a chemical called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baricitinib&quot;&gt;baricitinib&lt;/a&gt; in a small pill that Auri takes multiple times a day. We can&apos;t trust her to swallow a pill, so thankfully it dissolves very easily in a tiny amount of water that we mix with yogurt. So far we haven&apos;t had any difficulties, and she&apos;s been tolerating it without obvious side effects. However, the side effects that we will be concerned about would take time to  develop. The drug acts by interrupting her cells&apos; ability to recognize and respond to certain signals. While it targets the immune signals that her disease is sending into overdrive, it also interrupts some hormones, like those from the kidneys that control blood cell production. In a multi-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026004/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the drug for different but very related reasons, children received and tolerated baricitinib well for an average of 3.5 years. For these children, the alternatives just simply aren&apos;t acceptable and &lt;strong&gt;the modest risk that this drug poses is heavily outweighed by the severity of their disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encouraging Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a day or two of Auri starting this drug, we noticed some small but remarkable improvements in her general attitude. Having slept poorly for over a week, Auri went through the night without complaint. She switched from two naps a day to a single, appearing less tired and fatigued over all. Within another day or two, she was holding herself up better. One of the most distressing changes over the past month has been how &lt;em&gt;loose&lt;/em&gt; she&apos;s gotten when you pick her up. Having mostly laid on my shoulder when carried, she&apos;s begun to engage her back muscles again and sit up more in my arms. She&apos;s also using her voice more. In the car on the way back from Duke this Tuesday, she was talking up a storm. Having talked much less over the month of February (sticking mostly to &quot;mama&quot;), she&apos;s bringing back some baby talk that had mostly disappeared. At physical therapy, she had a strong day. Her ability to participate in PT has gotten progressively worse, week by week. This past Thursday, she was able to kneel and crawl with help. We even just got back from the pool, where Auri continued to show increased strength and coordination. I&apos;m too nervous to call it a trend yet, but I hope this continues.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug therapy I&apos;ve mentioned has risks, hasn&apos;t been tested enough in children, but has shown some promising results. We were told last week that it wasn&apos;t an option. With the help of some great people, we pulled together a team that includes doctors at Duke and the NIH. One has extensive experience with this drug and related diseases, the other (and our primary specialist) cares for children undergoing complex treatments. They escalated Auri&apos;s case and decided Tuesday that they are going to do this for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow Auri will be given a dangerous weapon to fight with. It terrifies me, but she doesn&apos;t have any other choice. Should this work for her, she will remain immunocompromised for years, perhaps her entire childhood and longer. We&apos;ve been told it may take 4 months to have confidence that it&apos;s really working, but parents have witnessed an immediate (albeit modest) overall improvement. Auri may be one of fewer than a handful of children ever to be granted this opportunity, early enough to make a real difference. I trust that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must follow Mary Oliver&apos;s advice from her poem, &quot;Love Sorrow,&quot; and smile, lest our girl forget the world before the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Love sorrow. She is yours now, and you must
take care of what has been
given. Brush her hair, help her
into her little coat, hold her hand,
especially when crossing a street. For, think,

what if you should lose her? Then you would be
sorrow yourself; her drawn face, her sleeplessness
would be yours. Take care, touch
her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone. And smile, that she does not
altogether forget the world before the lesson.
Have patience in abundance. And do not
ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself, which is to say, possibly, again,
abandoned. She is strange, mute, difficult,
sometimes unmanageable but, remember, she is a child.
And amazing things can happen. And you may see,

as the two of you go
walking together in the morning light, how
little by little she relaxes; she looks about her;
she begins to grow.”

― Mary Oliver, Red Bird

I&apos;ll cut to chase and tell you that of the 285 patients with data available for a global study, 73.7% ended up &quot;profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function.&quot; The disease is characterized by an onset within the first two years of life that results in deterioration of the brain lasting &quot;several months&quot; (in my reading anywhere from 1 to 12 months, seemingly around 8 months). At that point, the brain deterioration appears to stop and not continue. Rather, patients suffer long term, chronic, autoimmune disease (sometimes similar to lupus, sometimes milder) and the serious consequences of their disability. Generally, this seems to include intellectual disability (although Auri&apos;s early MRI didn&apos;t indicated damage in the basal ganglia that might make it worse). Mortality rates in childhood are high (20%), but it seems more likely to claim kids that present very early or right after birth with serious complications. The natural course of this disease seems like it will leave Auri alive, but severely disabled. We&apos;ve been witness to Auri&apos;s steady and progressive deterioration for at least a couple of months. We don&apos;t know if nor when it will stop, nor how much of her will remain when it does. Our hope is for an immediate cessation of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some hope. Auri&apos;s mutation has not been inherited. It was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation; which means that once confirmed there will be no need to test anybody else (including Max and Lennox). Additionally, the disease mechanics and involved genes are fairly well understood as a type 1 interferon autoimmune disorder. What does that mean? It means that there are effective drugs that are being used for other immune disorders that involve the same pathway (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). In fact, within the last couple of years and in a handful of cases they&apos;ve been used with success for AGS. However, to the best of my knowledge and research, there has never been an AGS patient confirmed this early nor offered this treatment before or during the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. It stands to reason that it could have a profound impact on her outcome. Unfortunately, I&apos;m under the impression that the FDA status of these drugs has very recently changed and that they might not be available for compassionate use. We may need a clinical researcher to devise or revise a clinical study to make them accessible for treatment. I have absolutely no idea how difficult it will be to make this happen, but I intend to pour everything I can into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spoken via e-mail with the researcher involved in trialing therapies for AGS and he pointed me toward a couple of studies. There have only been a few. Here&apos;s before and after video of treatment with an immunomodulator initiated 16 months after disease onset (much, much later than Auri and after the neurodegenerative episode). I don&apos;t have the genetic results yet to confirm whether he shares exactly the same mutation, but the same gene is involved. He also presented signs and symptoms at a relatively similar time. Even the description of his MRI at 16 months of age sounds similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I&apos;m hoping that there&apos;s a way to keep this disease from stealing our daughter entirely. However, we must assume that our lives and hers will be harrowingly different than what we had expected. We&apos;re grateful for all the expressions of support that we&apos;ve received from friends and family. I&apos;m beholden to Natalie for the incredible strength she&apos;s demonstrated for Auri and me. I think that together we can keep our family in one piece, but I&apos;m terrified of the price we&apos;re going to pay. Please think and send positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's Suspected Disease]]></title><description><![CDATA[At this point I think everyone has heard the term "leukodystrophy," and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where…]]></description><link>https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At this point I think everyone has heard the term &quot;leukodystrophy,&quot; and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where Auri is at. I&apos;m not sure how long we&apos;ve been concerned about her, but I think we always noticed that she hasn&apos;t develop as fast or early as Max and Lennox. For the most part, though, she hit her milestones until about 12 months (middle of November). She failed her assessment for gross motor development (crawling, pulling up, walking, etc.). We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but around Christmas we all got sick, Auri with fever. We were all beat up until after New Years, and we noticed that Auri didn&apos;t bounce back. It really took the wind out of her and she started struggling. We looked at some old pictures and videos and realized she had been regressing. She doesn&apos;t sit up by herself, can&apos;t really get out of sitting or do it unassisted, and was generally struggling to crawl around. We took her to the E.R. at Duke on Monday. She had an MRI that shows abnormal white matter changes in her brain that &quot;raise concerns for leukodystrophy.&quot; They took spinal fluid samples, blood, etc. and sent them out for analysis and genetic testing. So far, every test for something simple has been normal; but the ones for the scary stuff won&apos;t send results for a week or two. We&apos;re just waiting. Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for this likelihood because everyone involved in her case has been in agreement that it does look like a leukodystrophy. By now you&apos;ve googled; you can imagine my terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I figured you might be relieved to see that my butter bean is laughing and playing. We&apos;re spending a lot of quality time with her. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen, but I&apos;m happy if we noticed early because she&apos;s still a lot of fun.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m grateful for all of your love. Just wish the best for her and my boys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
