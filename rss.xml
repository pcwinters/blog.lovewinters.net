  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She&apos;s leading research and treatment of AGS in the U.S. and had lot of information and observations to relate about both Auri&apos;s disease and medication. I left a little disheartened by our conversation, but not because of anything we&apos;re doing or currently witnessing. It&apos;s just undeniable that Auri&apos;s disease will be lifelong and difficult. Thankfully though, there&apos;s every reason to believe that what we&apos;re doing for her now will be extremely advantageous to her quality of life. Although nobody will outright say it, the medication she&apos;s taking is presumed to be successful at stopping neurological regression and encouraging for managing her future struggle with secondary complications. Consequently, Natalie and I remain hopeful but will forever be in a state of fear that the next setback lies around the corner. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re going to handle that constant stress, and I worry about the consequences for Max and Lennox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for both of my parents this week. My mother watched Max and Lennox back home while we were gone, and my father met us in Philadelphia to chauffer and provide support. Sometimes it feels like we can barely handle ourselves and Auri, let alone two older boys and two dogs (one with cancer no less). Every moment that somebody entertains our kids and gives us a chance to decompress helps tremendously. I&apos;m looking forward to a visit by my cousin and her girls, and similarly thankful for my aunt&apos;s visit a couple of weeks a go. We need distractions because whenever I&apos;m sitting still I&apos;m worried. At any moment, Auri could start slipping through our fingers again; and she&apos;s struggling so hard to hold herself together. I&apos;m finding it impossible to not obsess about every little thing she does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Cold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri&apos;s turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, but despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven&apos;t appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn&apos;t fully cleared up, she&apos;s pretty much back to normal sleep and I&apos;m hopeful that the worst has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we&apos;re panicking. We &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt; that Auri makes it through this and future illnesses without difficulty because any could trigger a disease flare. In a way, I feel like we&apos;re treading open water, one storm and big wave away from going under. Although she&apos;s still able to eat solids and drink pureed fruits and yogurt, Auri can&apos;t swallow plain water. Any further loss of feeding ability or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we&apos;re desperately trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and continued health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week. Unfortunately, with two toddlers in school, there&apos;s not a whole lot we can do to keep her away from bugs and germs while she regains her strength. We nervously wait, watch, and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes from CHOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country&apos;s  (and probably the world&apos;s) experts in AGS. They&apos;re also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we&apos;ve managed to get prescribed locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Dr. Vanderver related the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become more available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Based on a quick assessment, Dr. Vanderver guessed that Auri may suffer a &quot;moderate&quot; disease course (or somewhere in the middle of the disease spectrum), but I have my doubts about this based on the frightening slide that we witnessed in February. The team at CHOP thought that we might have disrupted the disease somewhere in the middle of a regressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri&apos;s life. Her risk of neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything definitive. Allowing for conjecture based on limited observations, we can hope that CHOP&apos;s three-year monitoring of patients on this drug suggests a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver shared that they have not seen a patient&apos;s neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats; most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure. This doesn&apos;t necessarily mean the drug is working, and we can&apos;t treat it like a magic bullet. We received a sobering list of things to watch for, both drug and disease related, that underscore the seriousness of what we&apos;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&apos;ve left with encouraging news. They&apos;ve treated a child as young as two months of age that has appeared to benefit. Relatively speaking, there haven&apos;t been any significant, adverse drug induced events for the children they&apos;re treating. And, they have had children successfully on this drug for multiple years. Considering that CHOP continues to prescribe and research this medication for these children, we can assume that there&apos;s a reasonable benefit to the patients. Our uncertainty about whether we are seeing improvements so quickly has also been resolved. I&apos;d read this previously, but Dr. Vanderver confirmed that the drug &quot;works immediately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that continues to support us. For now, things are still going well and moving in a positive direction. Auri&apos;s much happier than she was before we started her medication and she continues to put on weight and slowly improve. We&apos;re in the process of ordering assistive equipment (like a supportive seat, stander, and stroller) that should make things a little easier on us. We&apos;re all adjusting and trying to experience each day with grace and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, this week has put to rest however worried I&apos;ve been about inflating Auri&apos;s progress. Of course, I just can&apos;t continue without adding that there&apos;s a long way to go and a lot of unknowns. But, with that said, I&apos;d like to share that others have confirmed our observations and remarked on Auri&apos;s improvement. On Tuesday and Thursday, we&apos;ve had followups with Auri&apos;s doctor managing treatment and her neurologist, respectively. Both have said that she&apos;s doing notably better than when they had last seen her. For our neurologist, it has been over a month, during which Auri had gotten much, much worse. This indicates a really strong bounce back that has been, to me, literally unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago and only just after starting her medicine, Auri was feeling better but &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA&quot;&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she&apos;s progressively engaging her core muscles more and holding her body and head up better. Day by day we see continued improvement and I try to take notes of anything new. This past week, Auri has been extending her arms more and reaching over her head, dancing, and bouncing in the tub to make waves. These are little things, but they represent a strengthening of her core and neck muscles that had gotten much harder for her to control. Although she&apos;s not crawling yet, she has tried to get her knees up and pull herself forward in an army crawl. All this is happening for a girl that had two weeks ago largely stopped moving or twisting while on her back. I&apos;ve even caught her waking up from a nap &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; doing happy baby pose (on her back reaching out toward her pulled in feet). And, she&apos;s gained almost a pound (13 oz) in about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These small improvements continue to stack, in defiance of my reticence to celebrate them. Given how much we&apos;ve been grieving, I needed an expert to weight in before I could believe it. I can&apos;t really describe how much better we&apos;re all feeling, so if a picture is worth a thousand words, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/LxwLZ8MeyRvv7txQA&quot;&gt;a video is worth a million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Auri and Hope, Into the Unknown]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having started Auri's drug therapy, we're inching into the unknown, still carrying the fear that has caused us indescribable grief.

However, this week has brought us hope, something we haven&apos;t felt in what feels like an eternity. Last month I was certain we were losing our girl, but a spectrum of possibilities is opening before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re cautiously watching Auri feel better and get a little stronger. I would never have believed it if you had told me that I would be celebrating my daughter simply lifting her head up, but a picture from Natalie of her sitting up in a grocery cart brought me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the little things right now that both encourage and terrify me. Before we began this therapy, every day since December had been worse than the one before it. Since Saturday, February 16th, every day has been better. Is it too soon to celebrate? Of course. But, am I scrutinizing every moment? Of course. Something is happening, but it will be much longer before we know exactly what, why, and whether it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confounding Factors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, Natalie and I believe that we&apos;ve observed improvement after Auri has had blood taken for lab tests. At first we thought we were making it up, but now that we understand her disease better it seems plausible. When she loses blood, the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I&quot;&gt;interferon cytokines&lt;/a&gt; in her system would be temporarily reduced. Both on Tuesday and Thursday before starting her drug, she gave a large amount of blood to screen for viruses and other signs of infection. Additionally, children with AGS sometimes suffer flares when they get sick. The primary cause of this disease involves the immune system chaotically signaling viral infection where there is none. A simple cold could make things worse, and the week before starting this drug Auri had a bad one. Her cold had just started to break as we started the drug, and we&apos;d expect that alone to make her feel better. We&apos;ve seen that effect before, but her temporary improvement has never been as strong as we&apos;re seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting on Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, we still don&apos;t have any data on Auri&apos;s interferon levels. It might tell us something about the severity of her disease and how it was progressing. Until we receive a few data points showing a reduction in her body&apos;s response to the disease, it&apos;s impossible for us to even confirm AGS let alone efficacy of the drug she&apos;s taking. Frankly, we got started in haste. She was getting worse every day and there simply was not time to waste. Though we still don&apos;t have all the details, the diagnosis is pretty certain. In the coming weeks, we&apos;re hoping to get data demonstrating beyond a doubt that we&apos;re observing measurable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve gotten some questions about the drug that I can answer. It&apos;s a chemical called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baricitinib&quot;&gt;baricitinib&lt;/a&gt; in a small pill that Auri takes multiple times a day. We can&apos;t trust her to swallow a pill, so thankfully it dissolves very easily in a tiny amount of water that we mix with yogurt. So far we haven&apos;t had any difficulties, and she&apos;s been tolerating it without obvious side effects. However, the side effects that we will be concerned about would take time to  develop. The drug acts by interrupting her cells&apos; ability to recognize and respond to certain signals. While it targets the immune signals that her disease is sending into overdrive, it also interrupts some hormones, like those from the kidneys that control blood cell production. In a multi-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026004/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the drug for different but very related reasons, children received and tolerated baricitinib well for an average of 3.5 years. For these children, the alternatives just simply aren&apos;t acceptable and &lt;strong&gt;the modest risk that this drug poses is heavily outweighed by the severity of their disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encouraging Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a day or two of Auri starting this drug, we noticed some small but remarkable improvements in her general attitude. Having slept poorly for over a week, Auri went through the night without complaint. She switched from two naps a day to a single, appearing less tired and fatigued over all. Within another day or two, she was holding herself up better. One of the most distressing changes over the past month has been how &lt;em&gt;loose&lt;/em&gt; she&apos;s gotten when you pick her up. Having mostly laid on my shoulder when carried, she&apos;s begun to engage her back muscles again and sit up more in my arms. She&apos;s also using her voice more. In the car on the way back from Duke this Tuesday, she was talking up a storm. Having talked much less over the month of February (sticking mostly to &quot;mama&quot;), she&apos;s bringing back some baby talk that had mostly disappeared. At physical therapy, she had a strong day. Her ability to participate in PT has gotten progressively worse, week by week. This past Thursday, she was able to kneel and crawl with help. We even just got back from the pool, where Auri continued to show increased strength and coordination. I&apos;m too nervous to call it a trend yet, but I hope this continues.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug therapy I&apos;ve mentioned has risks, hasn&apos;t been tested enough in children, but has shown some promising results. We were told last week that it wasn&apos;t an option. With the help of some great people, we pulled together a team that includes doctors at Duke and the NIH. One has extensive experience with this drug and related diseases, the other (and our primary specialist) cares for children undergoing complex treatments. They escalated Auri&apos;s case and decided Tuesday that they are going to do this for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow Auri will be given a dangerous weapon to fight with. It terrifies me, but she doesn&apos;t have any other choice. Should this work for her, she will remain immunocompromised for years, perhaps her entire childhood and longer. We&apos;ve been told it may take 4 months to have confidence that it&apos;s really working, but parents have witnessed an immediate (albeit modest) overall improvement. Auri may be one of fewer than a handful of children ever to be granted this opportunity, early enough to make a real difference. I trust that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must follow Mary Oliver&apos;s advice from her poem, &quot;Love Sorrow,&quot; and smile, lest our girl forget the world before the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Love sorrow. She is yours now, and you must
take care of what has been
given. Brush her hair, help her
into her little coat, hold her hand,
especially when crossing a street. For, think,

what if you should lose her? Then you would be
sorrow yourself; her drawn face, her sleeplessness
would be yours. Take care, touch
her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone. And smile, that she does not
altogether forget the world before the lesson.
Have patience in abundance. And do not
ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself, which is to say, possibly, again,
abandoned. She is strange, mute, difficult,
sometimes unmanageable but, remember, she is a child.
And amazing things can happen. And you may see,

as the two of you go
walking together in the morning light, how
little by little she relaxes; she looks about her;
she begins to grow.”

― Mary Oliver, Red Bird

I&apos;ll cut to chase and tell you that of the 285 patients with data available for a global study, 73.7% ended up &quot;profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function.&quot; The disease is characterized by an onset within the first two years of life that results in deterioration of the brain lasting &quot;several months&quot; (in my reading anywhere from 1 to 12 months, seemingly around 8 months). At that point, the brain deterioration appears to stop and not continue. Rather, patients suffer long term, chronic, autoimmune disease (sometimes similar to lupus, sometimes milder) and the serious consequences of their disability. Generally, this seems to include intellectual disability (although Auri&apos;s early MRI didn&apos;t indicated damage in the basal ganglia that might make it worse). Mortality rates in childhood are high (20%), but it seems more likely to claim kids that present very early or right after birth with serious complications. The natural course of this disease seems like it will leave Auri alive, but severely disabled. We&apos;ve been witness to Auri&apos;s steady and progressive deterioration for at least a couple of months. We don&apos;t know if nor when it will stop, nor how much of her will remain when it does. Our hope is for an immediate cessation of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some hope. Auri&apos;s mutation has not been inherited. It was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation; which means that once confirmed there will be no need to test anybody else (including Max and Lennox). Additionally, the disease mechanics and involved genes are fairly well understood as a type 1 interferon autoimmune disorder. What does that mean? It means that there are effective drugs that are being used for other immune disorders that involve the same pathway (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). In fact, within the last couple of years and in a handful of cases they&apos;ve been used with success for AGS. However, to the best of my knowledge and research, there has never been an AGS patient confirmed this early nor offered this treatment before or during the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. It stands to reason that it could have a profound impact on her outcome. Unfortunately, I&apos;m under the impression that the FDA status of these drugs has very recently changed and that they might not be available for compassionate use. We may need a clinical researcher to devise or revise a clinical study to make them accessible for treatment. I have absolutely no idea how difficult it will be to make this happen, but I intend to pour everything I can into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spoken via e-mail with the researcher involved in trialing therapies for AGS and he pointed me toward a couple of studies. There have only been a few. Here&apos;s before and after video of treatment with an immunomodulator initiated 16 months after disease onset (much, much later than Auri and after the neurodegenerative episode). I don&apos;t have the genetic results yet to confirm whether he shares exactly the same mutation, but the same gene is involved. He also presented signs and symptoms at a relatively similar time. Even the description of his MRI at 16 months of age sounds similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I&apos;m hoping that there&apos;s a way to keep this disease from stealing our daughter entirely. However, we must assume that our lives and hers will be harrowingly different than what we had expected. We&apos;re grateful for all the expressions of support that we&apos;ve received from friends and family. I&apos;m beholden to Natalie for the incredible strength she&apos;s demonstrated for Auri and me. I think that together we can keep our family in one piece, but I&apos;m terrified of the price we&apos;re going to pay. Please think and send positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's Suspected Disease]]></title><description><![CDATA[At this point I think everyone has heard the term "leukodystrophy," and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where…]]></description><link>https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At this point I think everyone has heard the term &quot;leukodystrophy,&quot; and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where Auri is at. I&apos;m not sure how long we&apos;ve been concerned about her, but I think we always noticed that she hasn&apos;t develop as fast or early as Max and Lennox. For the most part, though, she hit her milestones until about 12 months (middle of November). She failed her assessment for gross motor development (crawling, pulling up, walking, etc.). We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but around Christmas we all got sick, Auri with fever. We were all beat up until after New Years, and we noticed that Auri didn&apos;t bounce back. It really took the wind out of her and she started struggling. We looked at some old pictures and videos and realized she had been regressing. She doesn&apos;t sit up by herself, can&apos;t really get out of sitting or do it unassisted, and was generally struggling to crawl around. We took her to the E.R. at Duke on Monday. She had an MRI that shows abnormal white matter changes in her brain that &quot;raise concerns for leukodystrophy.&quot; They took spinal fluid samples, blood, etc. and sent them out for analysis and genetic testing. So far, every test for something simple has been normal; but the ones for the scary stuff won&apos;t send results for a week or two. We&apos;re just waiting. Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for this likelihood because everyone involved in her case has been in agreement that it does look like a leukodystrophy. By now you&apos;ve googled; you can imagine my terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I figured you might be relieved to see that my butter bean is laughing and playing. We&apos;re spending a lot of quality time with her. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen, but I&apos;m happy if we noticed early because she&apos;s still a lot of fun.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m grateful for all of your love. Just wish the best for her and my boys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
