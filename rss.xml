The drug therapy I&apos;ve mentioned has risks, hasn&apos;t been tested enough in children, but has shown some promising results. We were told last week that it wasn&apos;t an option. With the help of some great people, we pulled together a team that includes doctors at Duke and the NIH. One has extensive experience with this drug and related diseases, the other (and our primary specialist) cares for children undergoing complex treatments. They escalated Auri&apos;s case and decided Tuesday that they are going to do this for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow Auri will be given a dangerous weapon to fight with. It terrifies me, but she doesn&apos;t have any other choice. Should this work for her, she will remain immunocompromised for years, perhaps her entire childhood and longer. We&apos;ve been told it may take 4 months to have confidence that it&apos;s really working, but parents have witnessed an immediate (albeit modest) overall improvement. Auri may be one of fewer than a handful of children ever to be granted this opportunity, early enough to make a real difference. I trust that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must follow Mary Oliver&apos;s advice from her poem, &quot;Love Sorrow,&quot; and smile, lest our girl forget the world before the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Love sorrow. She is yours now, and you must
take care of what has been
given. Brush her hair, help her
into her little coat, hold her hand,
especially when crossing a street. For, think,

what if you should lose her? Then you would be
sorrow yourself; her drawn face, her sleeplessness
would be yours. Take care, touch
her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone. And smile, that she does not
altogether forget the world before the lesson.
Have patience in abundance. And do not
ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself, which is to say, possibly, again,
abandoned. She is strange, mute, difficult,
sometimes unmanageable but, remember, she is a child.
And amazing things can happen. And you may see,

as the two of you go
walking together in the morning light, how
little by little she relaxes; she looks about her;
she begins to grow.”

― Mary Oliver, Red Bird

I&apos;ll cut to chase and tell you that of the 285 patients with data available for a global study, 73.7% ended up &quot;profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function.&quot; The disease is characterized by an onset within the first two years of life that results in deterioration of the brain lasting &quot;several months&quot; (in my reading anywhere from 1 to 12 months, seemingly around 8 months). At that point, the brain deterioration appears to stop and not continue. Rather, patients suffer long term, chronic, autoimmune disease (sometimes similar to lupus, sometimes milder) and the serious consequences of their disability. Generally, this seems to include intellectual disability (although Auri&apos;s early MRI didn&apos;t indicated damage in the basal ganglia that might make it worse). Mortality rates in childhood are high (20%), but it seems more likely to claim kids that present very early or right after birth with serious complications. The natural course of this disease seems like it will leave Auri alive, but severely disabled. We&apos;ve been witness to Auri&apos;s steady and progressive deterioration for at least a couple of months. We don&apos;t know if nor when it will stop, nor how much of her will remain when it does. Our hope is for an immediate cessation of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some hope. Auri&apos;s mutation has not been inherited. It was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation; which means that once confirmed there will be no need to test anybody else (including Max and Lennox). Additionally, the disease mechanics and involved genes are fairly well understood as a type 1 interferon autoimmune disorder. What does that mean? It means that there are effective drugs that are being used for other immune disorders that involve the same pathway (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). In fact, within the last couple of years and in a handful of cases they&apos;ve been used with success for AGS. However, to the best of my knowledge and research, there has never been an AGS patient confirmed this early nor offered this treatment before or during the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. It stands to reason that it could have a profound impact on her outcome. Unfortunately, I&apos;m under the impression that the FDA status of these drugs has very recently changed and that they might not be available for compassionate use. We may need a clinical researcher to devise or revise a clinical study to make them accessible for treatment. I have absolutely no idea how difficult it will be to make this happen, but I intend to pour everything I can into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spoken via e-mail with the researcher involved in trialing therapies for AGS and he pointed me toward a couple of studies. There have only been a few. Here&apos;s before and after video of treatment with an immunomodulator initiated 16 months after disease onset (much, much later than Auri and after the neurodegenerative episode). I don&apos;t have the genetic results yet to confirm whether he shares exactly the same mutation, but the same gene is involved. He also presented signs and symptoms at a relatively similar time. Even the description of his MRI at 16 months of age sounds similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I&apos;m hoping that there&apos;s a way to keep this disease from stealing our daughter entirely. However, we must assume that our lives and hers will be harrowingly different than what we had expected. We&apos;re grateful for all the expressions of support that we&apos;ve received from friends and family. I&apos;m beholden to Natalie for the incredible strength she&apos;s demonstrated for Auri and me. I think that together we can keep our family in one piece, but I&apos;m terrified of the price we&apos;re going to pay. Please think and send positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's Suspected Disease]]></title><description><![CDATA[At this point I think everyone has heard the term "leukodystrophy," and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where…]]></description><link>https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At this point I think everyone has heard the term &quot;leukodystrophy,&quot; and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where Auri is at. I&apos;m not sure how long we&apos;ve been concerned about her, but I think we always noticed that she hasn&apos;t develop as fast or early as Max and Lennox. For the most part, though, she hit her milestones until about 12 months (middle of November). She failed her assessment for gross motor development (crawling, pulling up, walking, etc.). We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but around Christmas we all got sick, Auri with fever. We were all beat up until after New Years, and we noticed that Auri didn&apos;t bounce back. It really took the wind out of her and she started struggling. We looked at some old pictures and videos and realized she had been regressing. She doesn&apos;t sit up by herself, can&apos;t really get out of sitting or do it unassisted, and was generally struggling to crawl around. We took her to the E.R. at Duke on Monday. She had an MRI that shows abnormal white matter changes in her brain that &quot;raise concerns for leukodystrophy.&quot; They took spinal fluid samples, blood, etc. and sent them out for analysis and genetic testing. So far, every test for something simple has been normal; but the ones for the scary stuff won&apos;t send results for a week or two. We&apos;re just waiting. Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for this likelihood because everyone involved in her case has been in agreement that it does look like a leukodystrophy. By now you&apos;ve googled; you can imagine my terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I figured you might be relieved to see that my butter bean is laughing and playing. We&apos;re spending a lot of quality time with her. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen, but I&apos;m happy if we noticed early because she&apos;s still a lot of fun.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m grateful for all of your love. Just wish the best for her and my boys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
