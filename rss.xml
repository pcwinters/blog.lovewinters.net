This will be a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt;, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I&apos;ve wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we&apos;ve been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I&apos;ve probably lost memory of, but I&apos;ve tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Act One&lt;/strong&gt;, where our lives changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mostly Normal Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t recall when it started, but Natalie and I have had concerns about Auri for a long time. I think we always felt sensitive about how differently she developed from her brothers. If Max and Lennox had learned something early, Auri had learned it a month or two later. She always gained skills just in time, before it seemed prudent to have concerns. If we brought it up, somebody would remind us that &quot;girls are just different.&quot; They might have been right. We&apos;ll never know. It&apos;s unclear whether she experienced disease related issues at an early age, and if she had, they weren&apos;t severe enough to notice. However, Natalie had directly voiced concerns about Auri&apos;s developmental to a friend as early as October. If none of this ever happened, we would probably just be telling people, &quot;every kid is different.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Up - November 13th - December 22nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, something felt different around her first birthday. Auri had been pulling up, but not really scooting. She stood on one of her ankles funny, and Natalie and I discussed bringing it up at her one year checkup with the pediatrician. Coincidentally, at that appointment in the middle of November our doctor shared that she scored low on a parent questionnaire about her gross motor development. In fact, she &lt;em&gt;failed&lt;/em&gt; it. It was concerning, but we were assured that it happens sometimes. Given that everything else seemed to be continuing alright, we left hoping that it might be a fluke. We had given voice to our concerns, at least; and the pediatrician assured us that she sees more false positives than genuine issues with these questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this period, tensions seemed to be really high in our marriage. In retrospect,  I think we were registering that something wasn&apos;t going well. At the time, I felt like Natalie and I weren&apos;t on the same page. Auri was constantly complaining to be picked up, and we must have had a hundred arguments about training her to be more independent. After a year of doing everything for a baby, I know that we were both hoping that things would get easier. Auri could and would crawl to play by herself,  but I think that she started demanding more of us. We didn&apos;t realize that she was beginning to struggle. Though she was crawling and sitting up on her knees, I can&apos;t remember seeing her sit up on her butt. On her first birthday, though, she was having a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding more stress to this period, I was in the process of switching jobs. Throughout the summer and fall, I had been working through a great deal of frustration with my employer. I had been given too much responsibility, too few resources, and high expectations. When I successfully delivered despite these difficulties, I didn&apos;t receive any recognition. I resolved to leave in October, and started my new position just before Thanksgiving. All of this, and my prior over-focus on work, added fuel to the fire. Natalie, on the other hand, was caring for two children at home. She must have been hoping for Lennox and Auri to start playing together. Unfortunately, they just didn&apos;t seem to jive. Lennox didn&apos;t want to play with a baby; he had a much more interesting older brother. Natalie was stressed and she started painting. We were both subconsciously trying to address some dissatisfaction that we were experiencing at home, but we never gave it a name  or a shape. We just felt frustrated. In December, Auri was standing and nothing seemed wrong. We hoped it would continue to get easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Event - December 23rd - December 25th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days before Christmas, on December 23rd, Auri woke up with a reasonably high fever (I think it was &gt; 102F). She had slept through the night, but we could tell she wasn&apos;t feeling well. I sat in bed that morning and played her some music. She sat patiently, but looked distracted and disinterested. I remember being surprised that she wasn&apos;t more thrilled. She had always danced and really enjoyed music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Christmas morning, we all fell ill. It was a subdued morning, and Natalie and I probably just phoned it in a bit. The kids were excited, but even they lacked a whole lot of enthusiasm. I remember feeling &lt;em&gt;drained&lt;/em&gt;, and you can see it in this picture of Auri. We didn&apos;t know it at the time, but we now think this illness precipitated what came next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Something&apos;s Not Right - December 26th - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we visited friends that have a daughter close in age to Auri. I remember feeling like something was wrong, but not knowing how acute it was until seeing their daughter (a few months older) run around and chase the boys. Auri could barely crawl around and play with toys. Something wasn&apos;t right, and Natalie and I both knew it. By the week of January 1st, we felt like something was seriously wrong and we had to take action. Natalie phoned our pediatrician and asked for an immediate followup. During the visit, Auri weighed in at &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same weight that she had been a month and a half prior, and her &quot;slowness&quot; as the doctor described it prompted a call to Duke pediatric neurology for advice. The neurologist on call &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; recommended we bring her to the emergency room to expedite testing. A normal appointment and consultation might take weeks. We really weren&apos;t sure what to do, nor did we have any idea how serious it was. On Saturday night, Natalie and I went rollerskating on a date. We had a good time and didn&apos;t talk about Auri much. We didn&apos;t think it could be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; serious, and we were trying to turn a corner and focus on being more positive together and at home. This is the last time I can remember feeling care free.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we wrestled with the idea of waiting to make an appointment. But after reviewing old pictures and videos that night, we realized that what had thought was some kind of developmental delay had unequivocally become developmental regression. We had been so focused on Auri&apos;s standing and attempts at walking that we completely missed her struggling to crawl and sit up. We made plans to take her first thing Monday morning, and I drafted notes to provide to the doctors with dates, milestones, and gained and lost skills. At this point, she could barely sit up and we hadn&apos;t really acknowledged how drastic her changes had been. In August, she was crawling around and sitting to play with her cousins at the beach. So much had changed so fast. Sunday night I tried to take a video of her sitting up, but she just fell over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An Emergency Room Visit - January 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie hopped in the van with Auri just as soon as she woke up Monday morning and rushed to Duke. I had to take Max to school, and since Lennox was off from preschool, I took him with me to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed felt somewhat like a blur to me. I had fears that Auri might be suffering muscular dystrophy, and I kept asking about certain tests. I was so terrified that she would have a degenerative disease, but the markers I was concerned about came back normal. We didn&apos;t get any answers that morning, and I was forced to leave Natalie behind and head home to pick up Max. Still at the hospital, Natalie had to manage entertaining an infant through all the commotion. Without remembering the exact details of what happened, I know that they scheduled her for an MRI and a lot of blood work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t remember who helped put Max and Lennox to bed that night (it might have been Dan), but  after getting them ready, I hopped back into the car to drive to the hospital. On the way, Natalie sent me a &quot;where are you, hurry up&quot; kind of message. I just knew it meant she had something to share and I called her back. Somehow, one of the residents had committed a faux pas and read Natalie an excerpt of the preliminary MRI report. Natalie told me that they thought it was a leukodystrophy. I didn&apos;t know what that meant, and I almost crashed my car after looking it up while on the highway. I started hyperventilating and everything went dark.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Week in the Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[With this update, I'd like to give everyone a sense of our weekly experience.

We have a lot of regular appointments with doctors and therapists, but right now they&apos;re largely focused on long term management. I believe that we&apos;re transitioning from an acute period of tests and diagnostics into a treatment plan that&apos;s looking optimistically forward. Behind us are ultrasounds of the heart and kidneys, hip x-rays, broad screening for viral illnesses, and a host of other tests that Auri passed without concern. Moving forward, we&apos;re focusing on monitoring changes from the drug she&apos;s taking and lots of therapy. In my opinion, the drug is working and Auri&apos;s in a category of moderate AGS severity. Relatively speaking, she&apos;s incredibly lucky to have a chance at mostly normal development. We&apos;re working on helping her catch back up. Again, I have to add the caveat that the doctors and scientists involved refuse to declare success, but that&apos;s because they need irrefutable evidence from more patients. For now, we simply need to make sure that she&apos;s at a safe dose and stays healthy. In good news, Cigna accepted our appeal and will be covering Auri&apos;s medication. I&apos;m sure that we would have found a way to keep going, but this will remove an extremely large financial burdern (at least $4k a month). Now, we&apos;re looking forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 30 days, we&apos;ve begun a comprehensive therapy program for Auri. She receives support from the state of &lt;a href=&quot;https://beearly.nc.gov/&quot;&gt;North Carolina&apos;s Infant Toddler Program&lt;/a&gt;. The program has helped us coordinate and schedule a number of different kinds of therapists to ensure that she&apos;s getting the opportunity to rebuild and regain skills. She most recently had an assessment by a speech therapist, which I&apos;ll go into further below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Physical Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twice a week for an hour, a physical therapist comes to our home and works with Auri on gross motor development. Since she received her Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFOs), we&apos;ve been working on bearing weight on her legs and feet while standing and building strength in her core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auri&apos;s therapist will help her stand, make her reach across her body, etc. We tend to place her sitting on her heels, and let her play with toys at a raised cushion. We&apos;ve seen Auri redevelop  a lot of lost strength in her abdomen this way. Compared to a month ago, Auri&apos;s getting muscular. She might not have strong balance or coordination, but I&apos;ve definitely noticed and can feel a lot more muscle around her sides, back, and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feeding Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a week for thirty minutes, Natalie takes Auri to either Duke hospital or Duke&apos;s location in Brier Creek to work with a feeding therapist. They spend about a half an hour trying different foods, and more importantly, introducing different thicknesses of fluids and water. Our current goal with the therapist is to find the safest and most effective way to ensure that Auri is getting hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri recently had a video fluoroscopic swallowing exam done that uses an X-Ray machine to watch her swallow foods and liquids. She performed well, demonstrating a small amount of swallow fatigue. But, she manages food well and handles thicker liquids without aspirating. The report&apos;s prognosis was promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Prognosis: Fair for improved function with skilled speech pathology services focusing on stated goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Auri&apos;s occupational therapist, we work on development of fine motor skills. Once a week, and also in home, her therapist plays with her stacking blocks, passing things between her hands, etc. The therapist has boxes with little toys that she tries to get Auri to use both hands with. She has her press with her fingers on buttons and use toys that require her to  push hard with her hand. The goal here is to help her improve her hand coordination. Auri started to lose some skills with her fingers that she&apos;s been slowly regaining. At her worst, she began closing her hands and reaching for things in a closed fist or claw like manner. Since then, she&apos;s begun using open hands again and can help feed herself yogurt with a spoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Speech Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New this week, we&apos;ve started Auri with a speech therapist. Although we haven&apos;t yet scheduled  these, the therapist is recommending twice a week, thirty minute appointments. I believe that this therapy will focus on helping Auri with expressive gestures and language. She&apos;ll be doing things like  making animal noises to build speech skills. The evaluation involved a big checklist of questions like, &quot;does she look at Dad when you say his name?&quot; The answers to the questions produce scores split by &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt; understanding and &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; use of speech and expression. Considering the circumstances, I&apos;m happy with how Auri performed. She&apos;s within the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;incoming&lt;/em&gt;, meaning she understands language and speech. And, she&apos;s just below the range of normal for &lt;em&gt;outgoing&lt;/em&gt; expression, meaning she&apos;s a little behind on developing sounds and gestures. I&apos;m not surprised that she has challenges, considering she&apos;s lost a couple of months of normal development. I&apos;m a little sad about this, but in the grand scheme of things it means we caught (and hopefully stopped) this disease before it claimed her intellectually. Before these changes, Auri was wickedly smart and expressive. I don&apos;t believe she&apos;s lost that, but it makes me wonder where she might be now had she the opportunity to run around and explore. Still, this is &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; news, and she will probably gain a lot from this therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Follow-Ups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday, we take Auri to Duke to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dukehealth.org/find-doctors-physicians/joanne-kurtzberg-md&quot;&gt;Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg&lt;/a&gt;. At these appointments, they do a handful of blood tests and send a sample off for research. Right now, we&apos;re watching things like red and white blood cell counts, kidney and liver enzymes, and for signs of unexpected infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, things have been going well. I&apos;ve been watching slow changes in some of these values, but there has not been anything drastic. It&apos;s possible that they all settle where they are soon and we sit at the current medication dosage. At some point, probably after another few months, these follow ups will become fewer and farther between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Family&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like we&apos;ve really struggled here. We used to go out to dinner regularly as a family, meet up with friends, and spend more time together. Recently, we bought a portable chair that should provide Auri with enough support to sit anywhere we take her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out last night. Max had been asking for Sushi. It was a success! We had been waiting for this to make it through customs for about a month, and I&apos;m glad that it finally arrived. Since Auri can&apos;t sit in a high chair, it&apos;s been difficult for us to go places. Now I think we&apos;ll have more freedom and can get out of the house together more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Health Care, Equipment, Care Coordination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in general, our deep dive into the health care system has been frustrating. We have a lot of bills coming in, some with mistakes. We&apos;ve also had to work through exclusive equipment providers to order some things like a pediatric stroller/wheelchair and a standing table. Over the past few weeks we&apos;ve had Auri measured for equipment and orthoses. For whatever reason, this process seems designed to make it both difficult and lengthy. I have a few tasks on my checklist to follow up and work some of this stuff out. Hopefully, Auri will get some helpful things soon. Next week we&apos;re fitting her for a support vest that should help her with core strength and coordination. We just recently bought this contraption, that lets Auri walk around this us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a few conversations scheduled to talk with different people about different foundations, services, and other financial support options that might be available to us. I believe that Auri will qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits from the Social Security Administration, and she will likely qualify for Medicaid to help pay co-pays and co-insurance. Right now, the financial cost of this isn&apos;t big on my list of concerns, but going forward we may need to do things like expand our house or renovate for accessibility. I&apos;ll be speaking with a lawyer next week about the possibility of opening a special needs trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day by Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, between Natalie and I, we juggle getting Max and Lennox ready and delivered to kindergarten and pre-school. The morning involves breakfast, dissolving and delivering Auri&apos;s medicine, dressing, brushing, packing lunches, etc. It&apos;s usually a bit of a dash, but they get there. There&apos;s almost always a therapy appointment of some kind before lunch, and then Natalie&apos;s feeding one or two kids before naptime. I&apos;m at home a day or two a week, but Natalie&apos;s usually managing this chaos on her own. When she&apos;s awake, Auri just wants to walk around endlessly. Right now that involves Natalie having to bend over and hold Auri up while she takes small steps around. If she takes a good nap, Natalie gets a little break before doing the same thing in the afternoon. It always feels a little crazy when I walk in the door, because the energy in the house with Max and Lennox can get a little much. It&apos;s been difficult to make everyone happy, so there&apos;s usually some argument about dinner, shower, etc. We&apos;re making it through, but I know that Natalie and I are both exhausted when everyone finally hits their bed. If we&apos;re lucky, and we aren&apos;t always, Auri will sleep through the night and we get a good rest. In the past couple of weeks, though, we&apos;ve had wet beds, vomiting, diarrhea, croupe, and some bad nights with everyone. Our boys have been sick with one thing or another, and Auri has been teething and acting restless. We&apos;re guessing that she&apos;s both learning a lot and dealing with a sore mouth, so she doesn&apos;t always sleep the best. We kind of take things day by day and it feels like a coin toss whether we&apos;ll get an easy or a hard one. It&apos;s starting to feel a little more like it did before all of this happened, though. Raising three children six and under isn&apos;t without its challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things aren&apos;t easy, by any stretch of the imagination. But Natalie recalled recently that Dr. Kurtzberg reminded us that &quot;it could be much worse.&quot; I think that&apos;s probably the best way to  describe all of this and the ambivalence that we feel. Nobody wants something like this to happen to their child, but I follow the AGS family group on Facebook and it&apos;s really sad. For every child in Auri&apos;s condition or better, there&apos;s one or two that are &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse. Without pulling together this treatment for Auri, I&apos;m certain she would have been in the &lt;em&gt;much worse&lt;/em&gt; category by now. I have so much empathy for those children and families, and it makes me grateful for where we are and the trends we&apos;re seeing. I think I might write another post soon detailing how we got here. This opportunity for Auri is truly remarkable and unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and caring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anxiety]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my past and with mixed success, I've fought my tendency to withdraw.

A good friend once described me as &quot;insular,&quot; and, admittedly, I&apos;m an introvert that prefers the predictability and control of my privacy. For over two months, unfortunately, that space has been a veritable nightmare: dreadful, unpredictable, and painful. Thus far I&apos;ve resisted the urge to engage in self pity, trying, rather, to focus on exhausting options for saving my daughter. But what left is there for me to do and how am I to feel now? Where do I direct my attention and from what well can I draw strength? We&apos;re alone, committed to an obscured path; and there&apos;s nothing more we can do. We move through the dark, in hope of protecting our daughter from further harm, a journey without a destination. Consequently, my personal space has been transformed into an enduring emotional struggle; and I&apos;m tired. Yet I&apos;ve been forced to come to terms these past two weeks with the insecurity that plagues our family now and forever. And, the feeling of being &lt;em&gt;apart&lt;/em&gt; has built tremendously since my last update. How do I answer a polite question like &quot;how are you today?&quot; Can I share how I really feel? Should I? With every friend, coworker, and family member, I&apos;m forced to politely withold. Is this real stoicism? The truth is too difficult. This must be why support groups exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why I&apos;m writing like this now, when I&apos;ve mostly stuck to the facts in my other updates. Well, I get asked often how Natalie and I are doing. I don&apos;t speak for Natalie. Even though I know she can relate to much of what I&apos;m sharing, still, I&apos;m never confident that I can really answer the question on her behalf. I can&apos;t even answer it on mine. Without exaggerating, I can tell you that my feelings change every hour. I swing between grief, fear, gratitude, and hope: grief for my daughter and the changes in our lives, fear that it may still get worse, gratitude for her remarkable opportunity, and hope that she can achieve a semi-normal life. As I watch Auri fluctuate, through colds, infections, and fatigue, I reckon with all of this and swing back and forth, sometimes within intervals of a few minutes. Imagine living on a world that experienced earthquakes with the same period. You&apos;d be in a state of constant panic. How would you deal? Could you go on a date and keep from crying in public? We can&apos;t, but we can still smile for a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is, my best answer to the &quot;how are you&quot; question. I&apos;m sure that some can relate, and I don&apos;t think we&apos;re unique. But most can&apos;t. When this all started I just tried to help everyone understand that it was better to say nothing. Trying to find the right thing to say or trying to empathize with an incomparable experience just kind of hurt more. I think that remains true. The depth of this, the biggest and most difficult experience of my life (past, present, and future), can&apos;t be communicated and will remain largely unspoken of. I&apos;m grateful that I have a partner who can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You didn&apos;t subscribe to hear me complain. You want to know how Auri&apos;s been doing since my last update. Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t answer the question with any confidence until yesterday. Since March 9th, Auri has been stuggling with an eye infection, on and off low-grade fevers, and the eruption of her first two teeth. She hasn&apos;t slept well or predictably, has been weak and tired, hasn&apos;t eaten or nursed well, and has had us all sorts of worried. Despite all of this, I had been communicating my belief that it was temporary, a consequence of infection or teething; but, to be honest, I&apos;m not sure what portion of that belief was just hope. We wrestled with a lot of doubt this week. Fortunately, the belief doesn&apos;t appear to have been misplaced and Auri really seems to be back on track. As before, the rails are being laid as we travel, and I can&apos;t dismiss the likelihood of future derailments. In fact, I fear another cold is on the horizon (from some sneezing and coughing). There&apos;s no rest for the weary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In good news, here&apos;s Auri &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/E99jfQ5vXCreiUJTA&quot;&gt;taking some cautious sips of thickened water&lt;/a&gt; today. We&apos;ve been unsuccessfully trying to find a way to increase her fluid intake. She&apos;s been refusing everything we&apos;ve tried until yesterday. With this cup and to build her confidence, we&apos;re letting her take small sips of thickened water. Of course, this comes with her recovery this weekend and wouldn&apos;t have been reasonable last week. Nonetheless, there were a few moments between the sickly naps and crying that had me thinking she was still avoiding the progression of her disease. She&apos;s been playing the &quot;how big is Auri? So big!&quot; game with Natalie, lifting her arms above her head (so long as she&apos;s laying down). After work one evening, we laid on our backs and I held up a children&apos;s tablet for her to play with. She was passing the stylus between her hands and clearly enjoying scratching pictures on the screen. I haven&apos;t observed any neurological changes, and she&apos;s still feeling much better than she was at her lowest. Also, she really likes nutella...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote to appeal our insurance company&apos;s denial of her medication. My letter cited all the relevant research, and I provided a folder of about fifteen articles from various journals. One of these days I&apos;ll write about how we leveraged this research to get her treatment, but right now I&apos;m hoping it suits this purpose. I burned a whole cartridge of ink and delivered over a hundred pages after Cigna determined, &quot;with the information they had,&quot; that Auri&apos;s condition &quot;does not involve an imminent and serious threat to the health of the member.&quot; They&apos;ve denied the medication on the basis that there isn&apos;t enough evidence for its use. I&apos;m really not sure what the outcome will be, but I&apos;ve tried my best. The price of her medication wouldn&apos;t just bankrupt us, it would make the treatment impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also got some data this week. Auri&apos;s lab results provide molecular confirmation of an intereferonopathy. Between her first sample (before medication) and ten days after beginning baricitinib, expression of her interferon stimulated genes reduced significantly. I had hoped for results from her third sample before claiming anything definitive, but the initial data is encouraging. We&apos;ll need to see more samples, given that these levels would be expected to fluctuate during illnesses. I suspect that we&apos;ll see a positive trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Trip to Philadelphia to Gather More Information]]></title><description><![CDATA[Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children&apos;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She&apos;s leading research and treatment of AGS in the U.S. and had lot of information and observations to relate about both Auri&apos;s disease and medication. I left a little disheartened by our conversation, but not because of anything we&apos;re doing or currently witnessing. It&apos;s just undeniable that Auri&apos;s disease will be lifelong and difficult. Thankfully though, there&apos;s every reason to believe that what we&apos;re doing for her now will be extremely advantageous to her quality of life. Although nobody will outright say it, the medication she&apos;s taking is presumed to be successful at stopping neurological regression and encouraging for managing her future struggle with secondary complications. Consequently, Natalie and I remain hopeful but will forever be in a state of fear that the next setback lies around the corner. I don&apos;t know how we&apos;re going to handle that constant stress, and I worry about the consequences for Max and Lennox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for both of my parents this week. My mother watched Max and Lennox back home while we were gone, and my father met us in Philadelphia to chauffer and provide support. Sometimes it feels like we can barely handle ourselves and Auri, let alone two older boys and two dogs (one with cancer no less). Every moment that somebody entertains our kids and gives us a chance to decompress helps tremendously. I&apos;m looking forward to a visit by my cousin and her girls, and similarly thankful for my aunt&apos;s visit a couple of weeks a go. We need distractions because whenever I&apos;m sitting still I&apos;m worried. At any moment, Auri could start slipping through our fingers again; and she&apos;s struggling so hard to hold herself together. I&apos;m finding it impossible to not obsess about every little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another Cold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri&apos;s turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, but despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven&apos;t appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn&apos;t fully cleared up, she&apos;s pretty much back to normal sleep and I&apos;m hopeful that the worst has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we&apos;re panicking. We &lt;strong&gt;hope&lt;/strong&gt; that Auri makes it through this and future illnesses without difficulty because any could trigger a disease flare. In a way, I feel like we&apos;re treading open water, one storm and big wave away from going under. Although she&apos;s still able to eat solids and drink pureed fruits and yogurt, Auri can&apos;t swallow plain water. Any further loss of feeding ability or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we&apos;re desperately trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and continued health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week. Unfortunately, with two toddlers in school, there&apos;s not a whole lot we can do to keep her away from bugs and germs while she regains her strength. We nervously wait, watch, and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes from CHOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country&apos;s  (and probably the world&apos;s) experts in AGS. They&apos;re also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we&apos;ve managed to get prescribed locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Dr. Vanderver related the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become more available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Based on a quick assessment, Dr. Vanderver guessed that Auri may suffer a &quot;moderate&quot; disease course (or somewhere in the middle of the disease spectrum), but I have my doubts about this based on the frightening slide that we witnessed in February. The team at CHOP thought that we might have disrupted the disease somewhere in the middle of a regressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri&apos;s life. Her risk of neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything definitive. Allowing for conjecture based on limited observations, we can hope that CHOP&apos;s three-year monitoring of patients on this drug suggests a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver shared that they have not seen a patient&apos;s neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats; most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure. We can&apos;t say that the drug is working nor can we treat it like a magic bullet. We received a sobering list of things to watch for, both drug and disease related, that underscore the seriousness of what we&apos;re dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&apos;ve left with encouraging news. They&apos;ve treated a child as young as two months of age that has appeared to benefit. Relatively speaking, there haven&apos;t been any significant, adverse drug induced events for the children they&apos;re treating. And, they have had children successfully on this drug for multiple years. Considering that CHOP continues to prescribe and research this medication for these children, we can assume that there&apos;s a reasonable benefit to the patients. Our uncertainty about whether we are seeing improvements so quickly has also been resolved. I&apos;d read this previously, but Dr. Vanderver confirmed that the drug &quot;works immediately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone that continues to support us. For now, we believe that things are still going well and moving in a positive direction. Auri&apos;s much happier than she was before we started her medication and she continues to put on weight and slowly improve. We&apos;re in the process of ordering assistive equipment (like a supportive chair, standing table, and stroller) that should make things a little easier on us. We&apos;re all adjusting and trying to experience each day with grace and appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, this week has put to rest however worried I&apos;ve been about inflating Auri&apos;s progress. Of course, I just can&apos;t continue without adding that there&apos;s a long way to go and a lot of unknowns. But, with that said, I&apos;d like to share that others have confirmed our observations and remarked on Auri&apos;s improvement. On Tuesday and Thursday, we&apos;ve had followups with Auri&apos;s doctor managing treatment and her neurologist, respectively. Both have said that she&apos;s doing notably better than when they had last seen her. For our neurologist, it has been over a month, during which Auri had gotten much, much worse. This indicates a really strong bounce back that has been, to me, literally unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a week ago and only just after starting her medicine, Auri was feeling better but &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA&quot;&gt;still struggling&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, she&apos;s progressively engaging her core muscles more and holding her body and head up better. Day by day we see continued improvement and I try to take notes of anything new. This past week, Auri has been extending her arms more and reaching over her head, dancing, and bouncing in the tub to make waves. These are little things, but they represent a strengthening of her core and neck muscles that had gotten much harder for her to control. Although she&apos;s not crawling yet, she has tried to get her knees up and pull herself forward in an army crawl. All this is happening for a girl that had two weeks ago largely stopped moving or twisting while on her back. I&apos;ve even caught her waking up from a nap &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; doing happy baby pose (on her back reaching out toward her pulled in feet). And, she&apos;s gained almost a pound (13 oz) in about a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These small improvements continue to stack, in defiance of my reticence to celebrate them. Given how much we&apos;ve been grieving, I needed an expert to weight in before I could believe it. I can&apos;t really describe how much better we&apos;re all feeling, so if a picture is worth a thousand words, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://photos.app.goo.gl/LxwLZ8MeyRvv7txQA&quot;&gt;a video is worth a million.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Auri and Hope, Into the Unknown]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having started Auri's drug therapy, we're inching into the unknown, still carrying the fear that has caused us indescribable grief.

However, this week has brought us hope, something we haven&apos;t felt in what feels like an eternity. Last month I was certain we were losing our girl, but a spectrum of possibilities is opening before us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re cautiously watching Auri feel better and get a little stronger. I would never have believed it if you had told me that I would be celebrating my daughter simply lifting her head up, but a picture from Natalie of her sitting up in a grocery cart brought me to tears.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s the little things right now that both encourage and terrify me. Before we began this therapy, every day since December had been worse than the one before it. Since Saturday, February 16th, every day has been better. Is it too soon to celebrate? Of course. But, am I scrutinizing every moment? Of course. Something is happening, but it will be much longer before we know exactly what, why, and whether it will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confounding Factors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past month, Natalie and I believe that we&apos;ve observed improvement after Auri has had blood taken for lab tests. At first we thought we were making it up, but now that we understand her disease better it seems plausible. When she loses blood, the amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I&quot;&gt;interferon cytokines&lt;/a&gt; in her system would be temporarily reduced. Both on Tuesday and Thursday before starting her drug, she gave a large amount of blood to screen for viruses and other signs of infection. Additionally, children with AGS sometimes suffer flares when they get sick. The primary cause of this disease involves the immune system chaotically signaling viral infection where there is none. A simple cold could make things worse, and the week before starting this drug Auri had a bad one. Her cold had just started to break as we started the drug, and we&apos;d expect that alone to make her feel better. We&apos;ve seen that effect before, but her temporary improvement has never been as strong as we&apos;re seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Waiting on Data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically, we still don&apos;t have any data on Auri&apos;s interferon levels. It might tell us something about the severity of her disease and how it was progressing. Until we receive a few data points showing a reduction in her body&apos;s response to the disease, it&apos;s impossible for us to even confirm AGS let alone efficacy of the drug she&apos;s taking. Frankly, we got started in haste. She was getting worse every day and there simply was not time to waste. Though we still don&apos;t have all the details, the diagnosis is pretty certain. In the coming weeks, we&apos;re hoping to get data demonstrating beyond a doubt that we&apos;re observing measurable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Drug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve gotten some questions about the drug that I can answer. It&apos;s a chemical called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baricitinib&quot;&gt;baricitinib&lt;/a&gt; in a small pill that Auri takes multiple times a day. We can&apos;t trust her to swallow a pill, so thankfully it dissolves very easily in a tiny amount of water that we mix with yogurt. So far we haven&apos;t had any difficulties, and she&apos;s been tolerating it without obvious side effects. However, the side effects that we will be concerned about would take time to  develop. The drug acts by interrupting her cells&apos; ability to recognize and respond to certain signals. While it targets the immune signals that her disease is sending into overdrive, it also interrupts some hormones, like those from the kidneys that control blood cell production. In a multi-year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6026004/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using the drug for different but very related reasons, children received and tolerated baricitinib well for an average of 3.5 years. For these children, the alternatives just simply aren&apos;t acceptable and &lt;strong&gt;the modest risk that this drug poses is heavily outweighed by the severity of their disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encouraging Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a day or two of Auri starting this drug, we noticed some small but remarkable improvements in her general attitude. Having slept poorly for over a week, Auri went through the night without complaint. She switched from two naps a day to a single, appearing less tired and fatigued over all. Within another day or two, she was holding herself up better. One of the most distressing changes over the past month has been how &lt;em&gt;loose&lt;/em&gt; she&apos;s gotten when you pick her up. Having mostly laid on my shoulder when carried, she&apos;s begun to engage her back muscles again and sit up more in my arms. She&apos;s also using her voice more. In the car on the way back from Duke this Tuesday, she was talking up a storm. Having talked much less over the month of February (sticking mostly to &quot;mama&quot;), she&apos;s bringing back some baby talk that had mostly disappeared. At physical therapy, she had a strong day. Her ability to participate in PT has gotten progressively worse, week by week. This past Thursday, she was able to kneel and crawl with help. We even just got back from the pool, where Auri continued to show increased strength and coordination. I&apos;m too nervous to call it a trend yet, but I hope this continues.&lt;/p&gt;

The drug therapy I&apos;ve mentioned has risks, hasn&apos;t been tested enough in children, but has shown some promising results. We were told last week that it wasn&apos;t an option. With the help of some great people, we pulled together a team that includes doctors at Duke and the NIH. One has extensive experience with this drug and related diseases, the other (and our primary specialist) cares for children undergoing complex treatments. They escalated Auri&apos;s case and decided Tuesday that they are going to do this for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommorow Auri will be given a dangerous weapon to fight with. It terrifies me, but she doesn&apos;t have any other choice. Should this work for her, she will remain immunocompromised for years, perhaps her entire childhood and longer. We&apos;ve been told it may take 4 months to have confidence that it&apos;s really working, but parents have witnessed an immediate (albeit modest) overall improvement. Auri may be one of fewer than a handful of children ever to be granted this opportunity, early enough to make a real difference. I trust that it will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we must follow Mary Oliver&apos;s advice from her poem, &quot;Love Sorrow,&quot; and smile, lest our girl forget the world before the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Love sorrow. She is yours now, and you must
take care of what has been
given. Brush her hair, help her
into her little coat, hold her hand,
especially when crossing a street. For, think,

what if you should lose her? Then you would be
sorrow yourself; her drawn face, her sleeplessness
would be yours. Take care, touch
her forehead that she feel herself not so

utterly alone. And smile, that she does not
altogether forget the world before the lesson.
Have patience in abundance. And do not
ever lie or ever leave her even for a moment

by herself, which is to say, possibly, again,
abandoned. She is strange, mute, difficult,
sometimes unmanageable but, remember, she is a child.
And amazing things can happen. And you may see,

as the two of you go
walking together in the morning light, how
little by little she relaxes; she looks about her;
she begins to grow.”

― Mary Oliver, Red Bird

I&apos;ll cut to chase and tell you that of the 285 patients with data available for a global study, 73.7% ended up &quot;profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function.&quot; The disease is characterized by an onset within the first two years of life that results in deterioration of the brain lasting &quot;several months&quot; (in my reading anywhere from 1 to 12 months, seemingly around 8 months). At that point, the brain deterioration appears to stop and not continue. Rather, patients suffer long term, chronic, autoimmune disease (sometimes similar to lupus, sometimes milder) and the serious consequences of their disability. Generally, this seems to include intellectual disability (although Auri&apos;s early MRI didn&apos;t indicated damage in the basal ganglia that might make it worse). Mortality rates in childhood are high (20%), but it seems more likely to claim kids that present very early or right after birth with serious complications. The natural course of this disease seems like it will leave Auri alive, but severely disabled. We&apos;ve been witness to Auri&apos;s steady and progressive deterioration for at least a couple of months. We don&apos;t know if nor when it will stop, nor how much of her will remain when it does. Our hope is for an immediate cessation of this phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some hope. Auri&apos;s mutation has not been inherited. It was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation; which means that once confirmed there will be no need to test anybody else (including Max and Lennox). Additionally, the disease mechanics and involved genes are fairly well understood as a type 1 interferon autoimmune disorder. What does that mean? It means that there are effective drugs that are being used for other immune disorders that involve the same pathway (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). In fact, within the last couple of years and in a handful of cases they&apos;ve been used with success for AGS. However, to the best of my knowledge and research, there has never been an AGS patient confirmed this early nor offered this treatment before or during the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. It stands to reason that it could have a profound impact on her outcome. Unfortunately, I&apos;m under the impression that the FDA status of these drugs has very recently changed and that they might not be available for compassionate use. We may need a clinical researcher to devise or revise a clinical study to make them accessible for treatment. I have absolutely no idea how difficult it will be to make this happen, but I intend to pour everything I can into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spoken via e-mail with the researcher involved in trialing therapies for AGS and he pointed me toward a couple of studies. There have only been a few. Here&apos;s before and after video of treatment with an immunomodulator initiated 16 months after disease onset (much, much later than Auri and after the neurodegenerative episode). I don&apos;t have the genetic results yet to confirm whether he shares exactly the same mutation, but the same gene is involved. He also presented signs and symptoms at a relatively similar time. Even the description of his MRI at 16 months of age sounds similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I&apos;m hoping that there&apos;s a way to keep this disease from stealing our daughter entirely. However, we must assume that our lives and hers will be harrowingly different than what we had expected. We&apos;re grateful for all the expressions of support that we&apos;ve received from friends and family. I&apos;m beholden to Natalie for the incredible strength she&apos;s demonstrated for Auri and me. I think that together we can keep our family in one piece, but I&apos;m terrified of the price we&apos;re going to pay. Please think and send positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Auri's Suspected Disease]]></title><description><![CDATA[At this point I think everyone has heard the term "leukodystrophy," and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where…]]></description><link>https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.lovewinters.net/2019-01-12-auri-suspected-disease/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At this point I think everyone has heard the term &quot;leukodystrophy,&quot; and I thought it might be good for Natalie and I (and you) to hear where Auri is at. I&apos;m not sure how long we&apos;ve been concerned about her, but I think we always noticed that she hasn&apos;t develop as fast or early as Max and Lennox. For the most part, though, she hit her milestones until about 12 months (middle of November). She failed her assessment for gross motor development (crawling, pulling up, walking, etc.). We don&apos;t know if it&apos;s related, but around Christmas we all got sick, Auri with fever. We were all beat up until after New Years, and we noticed that Auri didn&apos;t bounce back. It really took the wind out of her and she started struggling. We looked at some old pictures and videos and realized she had been regressing. She doesn&apos;t sit up by herself, can&apos;t really get out of sitting or do it unassisted, and was generally struggling to crawl around. We took her to the E.R. at Duke on Monday. She had an MRI that shows abnormal white matter changes in her brain that &quot;raise concerns for leukodystrophy.&quot; They took spinal fluid samples, blood, etc. and sent them out for analysis and genetic testing. So far, every test for something simple has been normal; but the ones for the scary stuff won&apos;t send results for a week or two. We&apos;re just waiting. Unfortunately, we&apos;re preparing for this likelihood because everyone involved in her case has been in agreement that it does look like a leukodystrophy. By now you&apos;ve googled; you can imagine my terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, I figured you might be relieved to see that my butter bean is laughing and playing. We&apos;re spending a lot of quality time with her. I can&apos;t control what&apos;s going to happen, but I&apos;m happy if we noticed early because she&apos;s still a lot of fun.

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m grateful for all of your love. Just wish the best for her and my boys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
