{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Auri, Natalie, and I traveled to Philadelphia this week to consult with Dr. Vanderver at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She's leading research and treatment of AGS in the U.S. and had lot of information and observations to relate. I left a little disheartened by our conversation, but not because of anything we're doing. It's undeniable that Auri's disease will be lifelong and difficult. Thankfully, there's every reason to believe that what we're doing for her will be extremely important to her quality of life. The medication she's taking has been seemingly successful at stopping neurological regression, but she's always going to struggle with some level of disability and secondary complications. Consequently, Natalie and I will forever be in a state of fear that the next setback is on the horizon. I don't know how we're going to handle that constant stress, and, frankly, I worry about the consequences for Max and Lennox. </p>\n<p>I'm grateful for both of my parents. My mother watched Max and Lennox back home while we were gone, and my father met us in Philadelphia to chauffer us around and provide support. Sometimes it feels like we can barely handle ourselves and Auri, let alone two older boys and two dogs (one with cancer). Every moment that somebody entertains our kids and gives us a chance to decompress helps tremendously. I'm looking forward to a visit by my cousin and her girls, and similarly thankful for a visit from my Aunt a couple of weeks a go. We need distractions because every moment I'm sitting still I'm worried about my daughter slipping through my fingers. The only thing that will dull the sharpness of that pain is time and improvement.</p>\n<h2>Another URI</h2>\n<p>We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri's turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, but despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven't appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn't fully cleared up, she's pretty much back to normal sleep and I'm hopeful that the worst has passed.</p>\n<p>It's incredibly difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we're panicking. We <strong>hope</strong> that Auri makes it through future illnesses without difficulty because any could trigger a disease flare. In a way, I feel like we're treading open water, one storm and big wave away from going under. Although she's still able to eat solids and drink pureed fruits and yogurt, Auri can't swallow plain water. Any further loss of swallowing coordination or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we're desperately trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and good health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week. Unfortunately, with two toddlers in school, there's not a whole lot we can do to keep her healthy while she regains strength. We nervously wait and watch.</p>\n<h2>Notes from CHOP</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country's  (and probably the world's) experts in AGS. They're also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we've managed to secure locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Having done a lot of research myself, I mostly confirmed things that I suspected or were suggested by (now out of date) research articles. Dr. Vanderver confirmed the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become widely available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis, and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Based solely on a quick and shallow assessment, Dr. Vanderver guessed that Auri may suffer a \"moderate\" disease course (or somewhere in the middle of the disease spectrum). I have my doubts about this based on the frightening slide that we witnessed. The team at CHOP thought that we might have disrupted the disease somewhere in the middle of a regressive episode.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri's life. Her risk of severe neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything definitive. Allowing for conjecture  based on limited observations, we can hope that CHOP's three-year research of patients on this drug suggest a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver shared that they have not seen a patient's neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats; most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure. This doesn't necessarily mean the drug is working, and we can't treat it like a magic bullet. We received a sobering list of things to watch for, both drug and disease related, that underscore the seriousness of what we're dealing with.</p>\n<p>However, I've left with encouraging news. They've treated a child as young as two months of age that has appeared to benefit. Relatively speaking, there haven't been any significant, adverse drug induced events for children. And, they have children successfully on this drug for multiple years. Considering that CHOP continues to prescribe and research this medication for these children, we can assume that there's benefit. Our uncertainty about whether we're seeing improvements so soon has also been resolved. I'd read as much previously, but Dr. Vanderver confirmed that the drug \"works immediately.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Trip to CHOP, More Information","date":"2019-03-10","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-03-10/"}}
