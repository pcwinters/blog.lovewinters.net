{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is <strong>Act Three</strong>, where we managed to secure treatment for Auri.</p>\n<p>For posterity, I've tried to write down and date everything that happened and led to diagnosing and treating Aurelia. This will be a <em>long</em>, three or four act post, mostly for me and my family; but I've wondered if it would help others that have or have gone through something similar. Since January 7th, 2019, we've been through a whirlwind of events and emotions that I have found difficult to digest. There were so many little details that I've probably lost memory of, but I've tried my best to reconstruct the timeline and include my thought process through it all.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Frantic Research - January 24th - January 25th</h2>\n<p>I didn't sleep the night that we received Auri's diagnosis, not because I was sad or nervous but because I couldn't stop researching. I began reading everything I could about AGS, and a particular name kept popping up. Yanick Crow seemed to be an author on every important paper. He had penned a comprehensive overview of the disease in <em>Nature</em> and even coined the term \"interferonopathies\" to describe a category of diseases with a similar pathology. He was leading one of the two clinical trials using reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs - HIV drugs) and had theorized quite a bit over the last ten years about potential therapies. The next morning, I found his e-mail address and wrote him. A portion follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'm reaching out in hopes of learning about early indications of efficacy within your RTI trial for AGS patients. We need to develop a plan of therapy (or understand the necessity of a trial) as soon as possible in the hopes of arresting or reducing [Auri's] neurological decline. I understand that these trials likely monitor interferon alpha levels in patients <em>after</em> their acute neurologic episode, but with very little in the literature about other scenarios we're looking to understand and try anything of use.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, he replied quickly and provided me with the clinical research he had been involved in with JAK inhibitors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We and others are trying to work out if the drugs that are currently available make a difference at the neurological level (I attach the papers that we have published on JAK inhibition), but I have to admit that it is not completely straightforward to know that (it is one thing to see an effect at, say, the level of the skin, another matter in regards to the brain).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had already read a ton the night before and had some context for his conservative reply. At least a handful of papers had discussed the theory behind JAK inhibition, and it seemed like it had been guessed that it could be a promising therapy for AGS. I blew past his warnings, thrilled at least that I had received a response and been on to something. Encouragingly, I also had success contacting CHOP on Friday and began the process of authorizing medical record release and signing up for their research studies. I started to feel some relief that we not only knew what we were dealing with, but there seemed to be experts and options. Surely we'd find something.</p>\n<h2>Making Contacts - January 25th - January 29th</h2>\n<p>On the 25th, after speaking with CHOP's research coordinator, I put together a bunch  of pictures and videos of Auri. I had hoped to demonstrate to them how early we had intervened in Auri's disease, so that they might register the importance of acting quickly. I shared videos of her eating, playing, and standing. It felt like we were getting connected to the team that we needed the most.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/ef64a/playing_for_chop.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 87.11217183770883%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Playing, shared with CHOP\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/04ac7/playing_for_chop.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/46aea/playing_for_chop.png 150w,\n/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/57e21/playing_for_chop.png 300w,\n/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/04ac7/playing_for_chop.png 600w,\n/static/3a5f23a323b2b50838390ec1f2a8e223/ef64a/playing_for_chop.png 838w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>On January 27th, our neurologist received word from CHOP that made me simultaneously hopeful and frustrated. It seemed to confirm that JAK inhibition, which had been tried with success by Dr. Crow, had been working in their clinical trial. Unfortunately, their clinical trial was closed. The principal investigator wrote as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We expect to re-open our trial of baricitib soon, though we are not enrolling yet. It is a janus kinase inhibitor, and we think blocks the IFN mediated end organ damage. We see moderate success, in particular for these kids with later onset.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the following days, I scheduled a clinical visit with CHOP for February 21st and set up to have blood samples sent to them for testing the activity of \"interferon stimulated genes.\" The scores computed from these samples would confirm whether Auri had this disease and possibly tell us something about its severity.</p>\n<h2>Trying to Figure Out What to Do - January 29th - February 4th</h2>\n<p>I had some confusion about the state of things, and I spoke with a college friend of mine, an M.D. that works in the University fo Colorado hospital. He assured me that since baricitinib had been approved by the FDA for an indication, it <em>could</em> be prescribed for any other reason. It was just a matter of finding a doctor that would prescribe \"off-label.\" It became clear that CHOP either could not or would not participate. A nurse practitioner described the situation to me over the phone as a Catch-22, and assured me that they would be restarting their clinical trial (<em>side-note: it's May 2nd as I write and they still haven't opened another trial</em>). I have more empathy now for the awkwardness of the situation; they're working diligently to collect data in <em>controlled</em> experiments to undeniably demonstrate this therapies safety and efficacy for helping <em>children</em>. This is no light matter, and we're taking risks not knowing what the long term effects of this will be. Nonetheless, on February 3rd, I replied to an e-mail from CHOP's research coordinator asking about whether we were able to send blood samples. I was really upset:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I received your message, but I'm contemplating next steps. I was hopeful that your organization would be willing to either treat or guide treatment for Aurelia much sooner. February 21st represents an unacceptable delay to me and further loss of my daughter's QOL. Without any guarantees from CHOP, I'm hoping to pursue anti-JAK therapy at Duke. With any luck, we'll be discussing options this week with our team here. Assuming they take the lead, I'm certain they'll want to measure interferon levels. I don't want to submit Auri to any redundant or unnecessary blood draws.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fortunately, with all of this happening in the background, our neurologist replied to me after what felt like an eternity to assure me that she wanted to treat Auri:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I'm in agreement with your sense of timing needing to move quickly. I am going to get pieces in place for JAK meds if we need to do them here.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This looked difficult, though. The drug hasn't been studied well for this use, and barely at all in children. What's more, Auri's situation was unique. My research had confirmed what our neurologist described:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In general- the treated people I can find have not been in a clinical situation similar to Auri, so we are in very very uncharted waters here as far as effects of treatment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I could tell, there hadn't been a single child with AGS that had undergone this treatment at this stage of the disease. It was simply unknown whether it could halt the neurological damage, and everyone I spoke with offered caution about jumping to conclusions. (I later found out that this was not entirely true, but the children that have had interventions with JAK inhibitors could still be counted on one hand.) Still, the rationale in research seemed strong; and it didn't seem surprising that it hadn't been tried like this yet with such a rare disease. Auri had been diagnosed remarkably quickly. I couldn't understand why everyone wasn't jumping at the opportunity to help her.</p>\n<h2>All Out of Options - February 5th</h2>\n<h3>Dejected - Morning February 5th</h3>\n<p>I had a morning phone call with our neurologist on February 5th that destroyed my hopes for treatment at Duke.  I took this call in a small conference room at my office. I sat at a desk and took notes while we spoke. The team at Duke simply didn't have enough experience, evidence, or research to make this happen. And, CHOP wouldn't assist; they had a responsibility to establish evidence of this therapy working in AGS before participating in treatment of children outside of their study. However, if they thought through their research that it was working and knew that they couldn't re-open their clinical trial in time, I couldn't understand why they would not help. Our doctor didn't have the answers, and she seemed disappointed. </p>\n<p>I didn't know what to say. If there was nothing we could do, we were back where we started, hopeless. I had been grieving for weeks, assuming that I was going to lose my daughter. The diagnosis and my research had let me begin to believe that there was a solution and that we could save her. As it turned out, there was more experience with and evidence for the promise of this therapy than I had known. I felt so low, but I had to finish the remainder of the day at work. In what reflects the seriousness of the situation, she had suggested to me a few weeks prior that I focus on enjoying what time remained with Auri. Until this point I had been unable to slow or calm down. Ending the phone call, I remember assuring her that I would do so now. Paraphrasing, my response to her \"we can't save your daughter\" was \"then it's a good thing I'm spending quality time with her.\"</p>\n<h3>I Might as Well Try - February 5th</h3>\n<p>It seemed like every door had closed, but their was still one loose thread. Dr. Rafaela Goldbach-Manksy and her group at the NIH had originally established the treatment and monitoring protocol that was being used by CHOP. I didn't know enough about her group's work at the time, but I was aware that my doctor had attempted and failed to make contact with her. I thought that I might as well try to reach out. Maybe I could still make something happen. I called. She didn't answer. I left a voicemail. I recently wrote her a thank you, and I'll just let it tell how I had felt.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"... returning my phone call, gave me renewed hope on the very day that I had lost it. I had just navigated an entire month of grief, panic, and fear that included a humbling acknowledgement of a problem in my previously healthy child, a terrifying suggestion of a likely fatal leukodystrophy, panic that my other children might meet the same fate, the paradoxical relief and devastation of a rapid genetic diagnosis of a de-novo mutation for AGS, the hope of promising clinical trials, and finally the somber disillusionment that said treatment would be inaccessible to Auri when she needed it. Throughout most of January, I sat helpless while my daughter turned to sand and began slipping faster and faster through my fingers. As soon as I received Auri’s genetic report, I got to work on research. As a graduate student of computer science, I worked for Richard Bonneau at NYU’s Center for Genomics and Systems Biology. I felt uncommonly prepared to ensure that my daughter had the best options. I read so much. I took notes. I contacted PI’s. Within a few days, I became convinced that JAK blockade represented an astounding and perhaps unprecedented opportunity for Auri. Unfortunately, I quickly found myself helpless again. Our neurologist shared my eagerness to treat Auri promptly but was unable to garner the necessary support, neither in nor outside of Duke. We would have to wait until CHOP began enrolling in a follow-up trial. Auri’s doctor and I had a difficult conversation that ended with something to the effect of “good luck,” knowing full well that Auri faced an overwhelming likelihood of neurological devastation. That same afternoon after work, waiting in line to pick up my son from kindergarten and after having cried the entire drive, I decided to try calling you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I brought Max home and went through the motions with the kids: dinner, shower, book, bed. I couldn't believe that all of my efforts were going to come up short. I felt like I had worked so hard. At this point, I was in tears most nights in bed; and this evening was particularly rough. Lights off, trying to sleep, my phone buzzed. I received a text message from an unknown number.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Thank you for your message. We do not have a protocol for AGS but please send me your e-mail and I will send you our dosing data. The neurologists in North Carolina should be able to prescribe baricitinib as it is approved. We or [CHOP] can test the IFN score. When I receive your e-mail i will also cc [CHOP].  Pfizer had an anti IFN Beta antibody but this drug is not available. Will send more later.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>\"HOLY FUCK!\"</strong> I shouted. I can't remember what I did after that, but it wasn't sleep. I'm certain I replied, carefully, acknowledging where things stood and what I was trying to accomplish.</p>\n<h3>More Regression</h3>\n<p>While we waited, I kept researching. As much as I was capable, I tried to build an understanding of the disease and it's mechanics. I kept telling Natalie that I could understand what I was reading, but it was really hard to connect papers because I had no background. I had no recall, and simply couldn't remember details about what I had read the day before. I was trying to pull something together with little to no relevant education. It was incredibly frustrating. While I was doing this, Auri got sick again and this time it seemed much worse.</p>\n<h3>A Frantic Plea for Help</h3>\n<h3>A Miracle</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"How it Happened - Act Three","date":"2019-05-02","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-05-02-act-three/"}}
