{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>You might have heard that there was a clinical trial at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) using the drug baricitinib or (especially if you're outside of the USA) you may have heard about a related drug ruxolitinib. You might have heard that they can put your child's immune system at risk or you might have heard that they haven't been proven to work. If you've been talking to parents of children using these drugs, I hope that you've heard positive things by now and I would like to help explain where things stand.</p>\n<p>In short, we the parents have found these drugs to be very helpful. In just a very few cases, my daughter's included, baricitinib has appeared to halt active, ongoing, and severe brain damage caused by a later onset of AGS. But whether your child has mild, moderate, or severe disease, all parents that I've spoken to have found their children to be happier and more comfortable while taking one of these drugs. In many cases, our children have demonstrated continued development.</p>\n<h1>Clinical Trials</h1>\n<p>With baricitinib, the current phase 2 clinical trial in the USA runs out of CHOP (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554\">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03921554</a>) and comes on the heels of a successful phase 1 trial (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580\">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01724580</a>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Phase 1 - A phase of research to describe clinical trials that focus on the safety of a drug. They are usually conducted with healthy volunteers, and the goal is to determine the drug's most frequent and serious adverse events and, often, how the drug is broken down and excreted by the body. These trials usually involve a small number of participants.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Phase 2 - A phase of research to describe clinical trials that gather preliminary data on whether a drug works in people who have a certain condition/disease (that is, the drug's effectiveness).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's important to note that researchers at CHOP decided that giving placebo to participants of the second phase trial would be inhumane because of the benefits that they observed in patients during the first phase. Still, they emphasize in <a href=\"https://www.research.chop.edu/cornerstone-blog/multi-site-study-builds-better-clinical-trials-for-aicardi-goutieres-syndrome\">their PR materials</a> that efficacy has not been proven.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dr. Vanderver emphasizes that the current project is not about testing whether or not baricitinib works. Instead, it focuses on the creation of appropriate assessments and biomarkers for testing the effectiveness of all proposed treatments for AGS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Safety</h1>\n<p>On the issue of safety, we're waiting for CHOP to directly publish their findings. However, we're able to draw conclusions from presentations and abstracts they've submitted at conferences (including our AGS family conference in 2019).</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.childneurologysociety.org/meetings/2019-cns-annual-meeting/\">Child Neurology Society's 2019 annual meeting</a> in October of 2019, the team at CHOP submitted some <a href=\"https://www.childneurologysociety.org/docs/default-source/2019-CNS/2019-cns-program.pdf\">materials</a> addressing their clinical trials in AGS.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Label use of the Janus Kinase Inhibitor Baricitinib in a Genetic Interferonopathy, Aicardi Gouti√®res Syndrome</strong>\n<em>Vanderver A (Philadelphia, PA), Adang L, Gavazzi F, Ulrick N, Koh J, McDonald K, Peer K, Besnier C, Cross Z, Helman G, Rhee J, Takanohashi A, Armangue T, GoldbackMansky R, Shults J</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Results</em>: All serious adverse events were secondary to the underlying disease. There were variable laboratory abnormalites at baseline and on study. Baricitinib decreased IFN-stimulated gene expression and improved symptoms (e.g irritability, skin inflammation) as recorded by the daily AGS symptom diary. While traditional outcome measures were inconsistent over time, our exploratory AGS scale demonstrated improvement in neurologic function in a significant\nsubset of individuals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Conclusions</em>: Barictinib was safely administered to AGS individuals. We found floor effects in traditional outcome measures, but our AGS scale demonstrated promise. This study establishes the foundation for safety and possible efficacy of JAK-inhibitors in children with genetic interferonopathies such as AGS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134648\">Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Proposed Dosing of the Oral JAK1 and JAK2 Inhibitor Baricitinib in Pediatric and Young Adult CANDLE and SAVI Patients.</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29649002\">JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib in the treatment of autoinflammatory interferonopathies.</a></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Parent's Guide to Securing Anti-JAK Treatment","date":"2020-02-22","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/antiJAKGuide/"}}
