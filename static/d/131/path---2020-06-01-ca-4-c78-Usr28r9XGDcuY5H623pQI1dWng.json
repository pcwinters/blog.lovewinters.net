{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>There's no place like home, which is great because we're back in ours and going to be spending a lot of time here. We've made the decision to keep our isolation going for as long as it takes or as long as we're emotionally and mentally able. I wish there was some acceptable middle ground, but I'm afraid that there's no way for us to balance the risk. Last year we almost lost a child, and, having spent many weeks without hope, I feel like it's our responsibility to protect what fortune granted. If schools re-open in the Fall, our boys will remain at home. We're picking up groceries once a month. And, we're holding all therapies over video. This adds additional burden to our already tired and stressed family, but I'm confident that we're willing and able. At the moment, I'm actually writing from isolation in my house. I developed a cough, headache, and some symptoms after we were forced to let workers back, despite precautions. Thankfully, I started keeping my distance from Auri more than a few days ago when I noticed something felt off, but the persistent cough and low fever yesterday has pushed me over the edge and into in-home quarantine. This situation feels outrageous, but it underscores how little it would take to bring down this house of cards.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/fb3c3/bunny.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"bunny.JPG\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/77ab3/bunny.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/2a211/bunny.jpg 150w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/3064f/bunny.jpg 300w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/77ab3/bunny.jpg 600w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/3cffb/bunny.jpg 900w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/6ea5c/bunny.jpg 1200w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/119d7/bunny.jpg 1800w,\n/static/24cce74e245508c4de5a749deaaa6a8c/fb3c3/bunny.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>So, we're back home, spending time outside, building things, and enjoying our new house.
