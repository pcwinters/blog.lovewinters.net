{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Today marks four months of Aurelia's treatment with Baricitinib. When this started, we were given the expectation that it might take this long to know whether Auri would tolerate this drug and respond to it favorably. Since then, we've been to Duke every two weeks and subjected her to constant blood draws and lab work. Well... it <em>has</em> gone well enough and we're celebrating this milestone and spacing out her followups moving forward.</p>\n<p>The past few months may not have gone as well as I had hoped they would at the start, but I didn't really have any idea what was reasonable. Now that I know more, I shouldn't be anything but thankful and hopeful that Auri remains healthy. In actuality, I remain conflicted and struggle daily with anxiety. Auri is <em>happy</em> and <em>healthy</em>, but far from <em>safe</em>. I couldn't make it to her most recent appointment, but Natalie relayed a question of mine to Dr. K. I asked, \"what's the next milestone?\" She replied that \"there aren't any.\" We're in the uncomfortable position of celebrating progress while having little information about what to expect in the future. However, I remain hopeful. This drug undeniably halted her regression, and Auri has gone four months without any sign of relapse. While I've been terrified by every blip or change, be it blood cells rising or failing or changes in Auri's strength or attitude; she's been stable.</p>\n<h2>Germs and Dominos</h2>\n<p>Families with multiple kids seem to watch them get sick in succession. In our family the kids seem to take each other down one after the other like Dominos. Just a few weeks ago, Lennox woke me in the middle of the night vomiting. He spent the weekend sleeping on the floor in the bathroom with a fever. The following weekend, the same happened to Max (including sleeping in the bathroom). Max seemed to have it a bit worse, with a fever that peaked at 104 after a few days. I spent about two weeks checking temperatures in the middle of the night and trying to shield Natalie and Auri from getting sick. While I wasn't entirely successful, neither Auri nor Natalie seemed to have it as bad during the third and final weekend. Unfortunately, Auri did get a bit sick and developed an eye infection. Although we all seemed to have some eye redness and itchiness, this is the second time that Auri has developed puffy eyes and a more significant infection.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.98776309348997%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Eye Infection\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/2a211/infection.jpg 150w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3064f/infection.jpg 300w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg 600w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3cffb/infection.jpg 900w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/6ea5c/infection.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/119d7/infection.jpg 1800w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg 2043w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>The important part about this, though, is how it relates to Auri's milestone. We've been sick multiple times, and Auri has had fevers. With her disease and treatment, you worry a lot about whether any of these illnesses will develop into something severe or trigger a regression. Thus far, we haven't witnessed anything significant. With the exception of the eye infections, she's passed through them no worse than the rest of us.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<h3>Therapy and Neurological Improvements</h3>\n<p>Natalie and I probably overanalyze changes here. While we're relatively confident that she's been improving, I'm not entirely sure what to compare to.</p>\n<p>You can watch her <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/gfnQrzE8iC5moMPD7\">walking in the Hallway</a>, <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/NLPoxrj1Xd6pXCLY9\">playing in the grocery cart</a>, and <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/uFspcjRdAFTHAwCw6\">swinging at the playground</a>. You can see for yourself that she has challenges, but many children with her disease would find any of these activities impossible.</p>\n<p>This past weekend I spent an entire morning with Auri. Waking up, she kept saying \"buh\" and to my surprise pointed with an almost perfectly extended index finger. This is a subtle but important thing because she started to lose fine control of her hands just about when she started treatment. She's extremely inconsistent about it right now, and it seems to mostly happen in the morning; but when she's <em>really</em> calm she uses a modified pincer grasp and keeps her hands open.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/f87f3/pointing.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.271375464684%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAFAgP/xAAXAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQID/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAE0rmNEWFOdlAHJgveD/8QAHxAAAgIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxEEEBIhEyIx/9oACAEBAAEFArD1Rso9XGR5GEqblD2LEy2nOYI33//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwEr/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAR/9oACAECAQE/ASP/xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARARAjFBUf/aAAgBAQAGPwIdxfR+m2Ocp//EAB8QAAICAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESEQMUFRYYGRwf/aAAgBAQABPyGabqCvA3SRA+xU6msaeRJwvYRntdsFM1DmZvj6aPD/AP/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQA9qO/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAB/9oACAEDAQE/EB2Gf//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEgMf/aAAgBAgEBPxCBH//EAB0QAQADAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExQWGRoXH/2gAIAQEAAT8Qw8s68yrTGiHXlmOpcrXLAKWQVXNLD4hAQ51wQzQ14yAwaev0i1ga4oyJKVV+k+qOlx6n/9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Pointing\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/77ab3/pointing.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/2a211/pointing.jpg 150w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/3064f/pointing.jpg 300w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/77ab3/pointing.jpg 600w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/3cffb/pointing.jpg 900w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/f87f3/pointing.jpg 1076w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h3>Growth and Vitals</h3>\n<p>These charts are a little subtle; forgive me. I'm hoping that somebody in the same position as Natalie and I earlier this year reads these posts and draw conclusions about </p>\n<h4>Length</h4>\n<p>This length chart tells a story that only Natalie and I would immediately understand. You can see how inconsistent the measurements are, and it's a result of how spastic Auri's legs became. It's difficult to measure her length carefully because she has trouble relaxing her feet and legs when she's stressed. You can imagine that she doesn't like laying on a table with people trying to push her. I don't know what this chart will look like in the future, but it's very likely that Auri has suffered some growth delays. I imagine that recovery here would take a bit more time, but I don't think we've observed anything serious.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/32209/length.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 94.58689458689459%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Length\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/04ac7/length.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/46aea/length.png 150w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/57e21/length.png 300w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/04ac7/length.png 600w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/878bd/length.png 900w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/92a79/length.png 1200w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/32209/length.png 1404w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h4>Weight</h4>\n<p>Before this chaos <em>really</em> began, we had taken Auri to her pediatrician at the start of the year with our concerns. At that appointment we learned that she remained the same exact weight as the month prior. That's a bad sign for any child, and for Auri it was a signal that something was terribly wrong. There's a big dip in Auri's weight chart at 15 months, right when shit really hit the fan. This was <em>just</em> before starting treatment, when she was choking on food and water and suffered the worst of her regressions. She was persistently sick and got very thin. She went as low as the 13th percentile. Four months later, she's eating and drinking better and holding the 30th percentile. Within the first few weeks of treatment she became enthusiastic about eating and regained a lot of weight.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/32209/weight.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 94.87179487179488%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAATCAYAAACQjC21AAAACXBIWXMAABYlAAAWJQFJUiTwAAACJElEQVQ4y42U6W7bMBCE/f5vFqBFUKO/CzRB7MTVaZLize3s6rRipxWwkMTj4+xyyEMpheaHv+f/lBKFEEgpRZfLhaqqIq00xRClbx6/fw570Px2zlHTNNS2jQBrANumpa7ryFp7I2AbAuRB3ntpyDlL3Ft9m8k8bokbYPsZyMGp3Ys9KCeUgefj/6HCL2MalyJAKI0E6l3KBGzqWmr2T6CoSTI5WQZ5yjGgz0kswBbF/xKIgQJCFpFBHoDkFlDOgKaw1vAhcAZByZgWIllK2WIs1yxShtqM9hw2NeSU726KZ5BFWgiBOGwxPIiFvDHkjMKCUA21Hv0s4KC1otPpLCYuS7HTpGgQEKdXIqdrqav/0OnthX6//qKmrwDyNECh9VCbkbJHPaqqXoGARQdQGkYQp+lZoadeNfTj55FOlzM5jPMxk/MZcwtKkdca8vHyDGR1zgAKWLCi0EVDFikbLOwC+uF3zBXACMk3h0GA1+tVgImVBT6vgADGkAGpsIqYygRhY6dP5r8BKhx6PwxUXA+wJg2QDUg9lmngY1/uL5YRqA0F3ZJ3HVQFAZX/OTF2EMtV9Wi75bYxWpPqP7Bb7CV6rChv64V56kzH4zM9fftODY7vCoSnajRErgfOZ9zF9mLYthkX6P39AxZ6Xa40AbKpjRkEzKGheP7muMIFfd/L5nEfu4KDPcz9FvXX+Oe0D+u9V+5dfDQvWKNWPHl/sW4tw++/pkfThcvoP6oAAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Weight\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/04ac7/weight.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/46aea/weight.png 150w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/57e21/weight.png 300w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/04ac7/weight.png 600w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/878bd/weight.png 900w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/92a79/weight.png 1200w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/32209/weight.png 1404w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h4>Blood Pressure</h4>\n<p>When we first entered the Duke system, Auri had consistently high blood pressure.
