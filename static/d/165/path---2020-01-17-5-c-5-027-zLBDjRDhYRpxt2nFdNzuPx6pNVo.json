We're still eagerly anticipating a stem cell therapy for Auri this year, and, in order to measure its effects, Auri will needs baseline and post-treatment MRIs of her brain. Although we're still waiting for FDA approval, we expect it soon. Unfortunately, we had to reschedule the baseline MRI in December due to the illness I previously wrote about and yesterday because we let her drink an ounce of apple juice 30 minutes after the cutoff time. So, to the mistake and consequences. The mistake seems so minor an innocent. We focused on the need to stop eating many hours beforehand, but failed to internalize the stop time for fluids. The consequence may be a delay in this therapy that we have big hopes for. The odds seem high that she'll be sick again in two weeks when we retry and that we'll have to reschedule again. But, we might not have approval to start the therapy anyway; there's no real way to know if it matters. In this and in other ways, Natalie and I place ourselves under an extreme amount of pressure to maximize Auri's therapy and recovery. And, in this and in other ways, we have little to no understanding of how consequential our efforts will be. This has resulted in, for me at least, an emotional bankruptcy that requires a restructuring. Either by necessity or perspective granted me this past year, I'm adjusting how I think about Auri and her future. The bottom line it that Auri has been remarkably stable and consistent. She's developing; not as quickly as we had hoped, but straightforwardly like a child with cerebral palsy of similar severity. This year will be different, in that I believe we'll focus less on sprinting and more on running a marathon. We're raising a child with disabilities, and we need to develop more endurance to maintain a happy and healthy family.</p>\n<h2>Recap of the Last Year</h2>\n<p>The really acute, terrifying events of last year occurred between December 2018 and February 2019. It's an understatement to call that period traumatizing, and it has had lasting and serious effects on our emotional well being (something I constantly reflect on). The heavy stuff went as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>October 2018, we thought Auri might have a problem with her ankle.</li>\n<li>December 2018, Auri never really recovered from an extended illness at Christmas time. We began to worry. She was tired and slowed down.</li>\n<li>January 2018, on Natalie's birthday, she took Auri to the pediatrician who decided to call Duke Neurology. They suggested we bring her to the emergency room rather than wait for an out-patient consultation.</li>\n<li>January 7th-8th 2019, Auri had extensive workup at the hospital, including an MRI that suggested a leukodystrophy. My understanding of the vast majority of these diseases, both at the time and now, was that it would take her life within the year. And, to make matters worse, the nature of the inheritance of these diseases put the odds of Max or Lennox having the same close to 50%.</li>\n<li>January 23rd 2019, the last day that Auri crawled on her own.</li>\n<li>January 24th 2019, we received a diagnosis from genetic testing and talked with Auri's neurologist about the lack of treatment options. There was some suggestion in the literature that a particular drug could be helpful, but it wasn't well documented and there wasn't an open clinical trial to join. The literature also gave the impression that, with luck, Auri's regression might stop without taking her life early, although she would be \"devastatingly\" disabled.</li>\n<li>February 7th 2019, we were told that the drug wasn't an option and that we would have to simply hope for the best.</li>\n<li>February 8th 2019, I freaked the fuck out after a week and a particularly bad night of Auri not sleeping, crying all the time, and choking while eating and drinking. I contacted everyone I could and starting making demands. I labored over my words and writing, thinking that I would get only one e-mail or call, one shot at making it happen.</li>\n<li>February 13th 2019, day one of her drug therapy ðŸ˜€.</li>\n<li>March 2019 2019, we travelled to Philadelphia where they've been doing clinical trials. We couldn't develop any expectations from their experience, but I left with the impression that this therapy could work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frankly, after all that, it's just been a series of over reactions and panic. We've been terrified by every cold, cough, and fever. We've scrutinized every movement, changes in Auri's strength, and all the little details inherent in her treatment and trajectory. Auri began babbling again almost immediately, she began sleeping better, and she more than made up for the weight she had lost. Where in February she had become a sack of potatoes when carried, after the drug she began to carry herself upright in our arms. We observed a significant, immediate rebound in the first weeks followed by a slower, natural development. I've often answered questions about how Auri's doing with, \"she's doing much better than we are.\" Everyone has been quick to remind me that she seems bigger, stronger, and more mature with every week and month. You've all been right. We (or maybe just I) have been living in the above.</p>\n<p>Auri has grown and matured considerably since March. She's no longer a baby and pretty clear about what she wants. She loves to listen to music, expecially songs from Frozen. She has elmo, Olaf, Anna, and Elsa dolls that have to go everywhere with her. She's <em>always</em> asking to walk</p>\n<h2>The Present and the Coming Year</h2>\n<h3>Play and Exercise, One and the Same</h3>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/e577a/playground.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 95.4626334519573%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Playground\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/04ac7/playground.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/46aea/playground.png 150w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/57e21/playground.png 300w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/04ac7/playground.png 600w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/878bd/playground.png 900w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/92a79/playground.png 1200w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/132d8/playground.png 1800w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/e577a/playground.png 2248w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Playing looks a lot like <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/njMPgxqnsfmb1nFE6\">rolling around and singing songs</a> and constant <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/DEBycDe71ZN5U3KH9\">exercise</a>. At Christmas, <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnwFMATLRUEf92ux7\">Auri practiced hard in her gait trainer</a>. She wants to walk constantly, which requires us to hold her hands for support. I'm hoping to get her somewhat independent in her gait trainer soon, because our backs are killing us. She's come a long way since the summer. I remember telling a physical therapist how proud I was that Auri walked (with my support) \"at least 20 steps around the playground.\" At the time, we were still holding her under her armpits. Now we hold her hands. She still needs a lot of support and correction, but she's holding herself and carrying all of her weight in her legs. We can walk around the house or playground for an hour, easily over 100 steps though I've never counted by how much.</p>\n<p>Many days we'd love to just plop her in a chair in front of the television, but who are we to deprive her? She's a two year old that wants to explore, and we feel like it's our responsibility to say yes as much as possible. She's dependent on us, and we're determined to give her every opportunity. The therapists all say, \"life is the best therapy;\" and a physiatrist recently told me that being on her feet is better than stretching to help Auri avoid muscle and joint problems associated with disability. More than once I've been given the soft advice to take it easy or give ourselves a break. We simply can't. Everyone probably feels like they'd do anything for their children. Well, we've been called to task. Natalie and I try to tag in and out as best as possible, but we could still use a little help. Thank you to everyone that assists with other things in our lives because it helps us maintain enough energy to keep this up. This is just something I'm not yet ready to adjust.</p>\n<h3>Home Remodel</h3>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/db1a5/demolition.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"demolition\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/77ab3/demolition.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/2a211/demolition.jpg 150w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/3064f/demolition.jpg 300w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/77ab3/demolition.jpg 600w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/3cffb/demolition.jpg 900w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/6ea5c/demolition.jpg 1200w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/119d7/demolition.jpg 1800w,\n/static/cf95145e40901bac7f14a647fc759adb/db1a5/demolition.jpg 4048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Right now we're living at my mother's house while our house gets destroyed.

There's a positive feedback loop, too. The more fun we have together, the more patient we all are with each other. That patience is what has made the difference.

I find myself benefiting a great deal from regular appointments with a counselor. It might sound a little silly, but it's a big deal to me and the family that I was able to start cooking again. We still fall behind on a lot of other chores from lack of motivation, but less and less its because of outright depression. Although we're both oscillating, rarely do we find ourselves struggling at the same time. More likely, one of us picks up the slack for the other. The self-pity has been fading away, and the fatigue (emotional and physical) has been easier to overcome. I don't think that Natalie would be forthcoming about this with many, but it's all true. I don't feel particularly vulnerable about sharing. Rather, I hope that my honesty brings us (and others) some understanding or empathy. This trauma that we've experienced and the difficulty that lies ahead is very isolating. We're wounded, in a way, and asking for help sometimes feels like debasing ourselves. I don't really want to ask anybody for anything, and I'm grateful when it just happens.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/e8be6/couple.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Couple\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/77ab3/couple.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/2a211/couple.jpg 150w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/3064f/couple.jpg 300w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/77ab3/couple.jpg 600w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/3cffb/couple.jpg 900w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/6ea5c/couple.jpg 1200w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/119d7/couple.jpg 1800w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/e8be6/couple.jpg 1912w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>We're overdue for a date night.</p>\n<h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Year","date":"2020-01-17","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-01-17/"}}
