However, this week has brought us hope, something we haven't felt in what feels like a lifetime. We're cautiously watching Auri feel better and get a little stronger. I would never have believed it if you had told me in December that I would be celebrating my daughter sitting up in a grocery cart, but here I am with happy tears simply watching her lift her head up. It's the little things right now that both encourage and terrify me. Is it too soon to celebrate? Of course. But, am I scrutinizing every movement? Of course. I'm comfortable sharing that something is happening, but it will be some time before we know what and why.</p>\n<h3>Confounding Factors</h3>\n<p>Over the past month, Natalie and I believe that we've observered improvement after Auri has had blood taken for lab tests. At first we thought we were making it up, but now that we understand her disease better it seems plausible. When she loses blood, the amount of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferon_type_I\">interferon cytokines</a> in her system would be temporarily reduced. Both on Tuesday and Thursday before starting her drug, she gave a large amount of blood to screen for viruses and infection.</p>\n<p>Additionally, children with AGS sometimes suffer flares when they get sick. The primary cause of this disease involves aberrant immune system signaling of viral infection. A simple cold could make things worse, and the week before starting this drug Auri had one. Her cold started to break just as we started the drug, and we'd expect that alone to make her feel better.</p>\n<h3>Observed Improvements</h3>\n<p>Within a  day or two,  we noticed some small but remarkable improvements. Having slept  poorly for over a week, Auri went through the night without complaints. She switched from two naps a day to a single, appearing less tired and fatigued over all. Within another day or two, she was holding herself up better. One of the most distressing changes over the past month has been how \"loose\" she's gotten when you pick her up. Having mostly laid my shoulder when carried, she's begun to engage her back  muscles and sit up  more in my arms.
