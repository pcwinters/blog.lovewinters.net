{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Another URI</h2>\n<p>We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri's turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, and despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven't appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery. Although her stuffy nose hasn't fully cleared up, she's pretty much back to normal sleep and I'm confident that the worst has passed.</p>\n<p>It's incredibly difficult to describe how stressful this past week has been. Natalie and I try very hard to hold ourselves together, but internally we're in a panic. We hope that Auri makes it through future illnesses without difficulty. In a way, I feel like we're treading open water, one storm away from going under. Although she's still able to eat solids and drink purees, Auri can't swallow liquid water. Any further loss of swallowing coordination or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we're trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and good health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week.</p>\n<h2>Visit with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country's  (and probably the world's) experts in AGS. They're also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we've managed to secure locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile. Having done a lot of research myself, I mostly confirmed things that I suspected or were suggested by (now out of date) research articles. Dr. Vanderver confirmed the widening picture of the AGS spectrum and the long-term, life-long challenges of the disease. In the past, children would likely receive an AGS diagnosis on the basis of a severe neurological condition. As genetic testing has become widely available over the last few years, many more children (and adults) have been diagnosed with less severe disease characteristics. This implies an ascertainment bias in AGS diagnosis, and that the statistics on disease severity are heavily skewed. Furthermore, this broadened spectrum and some wider observations suggest that this disease will continue to be formidable for the remainder of Auri's life. Her risk of severe neurological damage may decrease over time, but the risk of relapse and secondary complications may continue longitudinally. These secondary problems occur as the result of small blood vessel damage and can impact the functioning of other organs. My hope is that this drug will reduce the chronic inflammation that causes these problems, but nobody has observed enough patients and for a long enough time to say anything meaningful. Allowing for conjecture, we can hope that CHOP's three-year observation of patients on this drug suggest a significant benefit to Auri. Without addressing cause-and-effect or attributing it to the medication, Dr. Vanderver admitted that they have not seen a patient's neurological condition worsen while on baricitinib. Again, this comes with caveats: most of the patients have already experienced significant damage that makes further decline unobvious and difficult to measure.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":null,"date":"2019-03-10","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-03-10/"}}
