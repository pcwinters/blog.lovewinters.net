{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Slowing Down</h2>\n<p>Heading in to Mother's Day, I think Natalie and I had been feeling a little defeated. For whatever reason, Auri seems to be feeling the same way. She's been adjusting (or perhaps adapting) to her circumstances, but this means she's been less enthusiastic about the hard work needed to regain the skills she's lost. Watching her cousin Tom crawl around the room like Speedy Gonzalez, she was <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/T1YRhQUUoD2Xv2YAA\">struggling to army crawl</a>; but she was at least trying. Watching her struggle like this hurts to watch, but not nearly as much as watching her give up. Both Natalie and I scrutinize everything Auri does, so this decreasing enthusiasm caused a great deal of anxiety and panic in us. We've developed doubts about Auri's trajectory, and we've been worried about backsliding.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Steady</h2>\n<p>Objectively, though, I think she's still improving, just slowly. Auri's therapists have observed and shared some subtle but important things like Auri lifting a leg while standing and shifting her weight, having more strength in her arms for maintaining balance, and using new consonants and expressions. We hoped for more, but I maintain the belief that we'll feel much better a year from now. This will not speed up in a day or a month. To be honest, it might not ever. But, we're moving forward. I'll never forget the fear of watching it move backward. This is <em>much</em> better.</p>\n<h3>Swimming</h3>\n<p>We've recently looked into aquatic physical therapy, thinking that it would be really beneficial for Auri. Thankfully, our neighborhood pool opened this weekend and showed us just how great it will be. On Saturday, Auri had a fantastic time <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/ggyTYnXvekduKnny9\">swimming</a>, splashing, and thrashing about. We've spent a couple of weeks starting to feel disappointed and worried that she's hasn't been trying as hard, but then I saw and felt her moving in the water.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/20407/swimming.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Swimming\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/77ab3/swimming.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/2a211/swimming.jpg 150w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/3064f/swimming.jpg 300w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/77ab3/swimming.jpg 600w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/3cffb/swimming.jpg 900w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/6ea5c/swimming.jpg 1200w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/119d7/swimming.jpg 1800w,\n/static/66a9de3022806fa2da35f4d8bcd69740/20407/swimming.jpg 2496w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Slow and Steady","date":"2019-05-20","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-05-20/"}}
