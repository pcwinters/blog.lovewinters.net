{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The 15th of June marked four months of Aurelia's treatment with Baricitinib. When this started, we were given the expectation that it might take this long to know whether Auri would tolerate this drug and respond to it favorably. Since she began treatment, we've been to Duke every two weeks and subjected her to constant blood draws and lab work. Well, it <em>has</em> gone well enough and we're celebrating this milestone and spacing out her followups moving forward. My understanding of her condition and my expectations and hopes for the future have changed constantly.</p>\n<h2>Weathering Storms</h2>\n<p>In December, Auri failed to bounce back from a febrile illness. We believe this precipitated her decline, and research into her disease seems to support this as a plausible trigger. Through January and February, it seemed like we couldn't shake our constantly recurring colds, each coinciding with some loss of skill or increased difficulty of Auri's. For that reason, we've been anxious every time one of our kids gets sick. We don't know whether another illness could cause a disease flare, but thankfully we haven't observed one. In the past four months, Auri has had a few colds, some severe, some less so. This past month, we had three consecutive weekends where one of our kids was sick with a fever. Max, in fact, peaked at 104Â° F in the middle of the night. We weren't able to keep Auri from getting sick, but she was spared what Max and Lennox experienced (sleeping in the bathroom, chills, etc). However, she developed an eye infection for the second time, this episode less serious than the first time it happened in March.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.98776309348997%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Conjunctivitis\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/2a211/infection.jpg 150w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3064f/infection.jpg 300w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg 600w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3cffb/infection.jpg 900w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/6ea5c/infection.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/119d7/infection.jpg 1800w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg 2043w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>The positive</p>\n<h2>Developments</h2>\n<h2></h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Auri's First Milestone","date":"2019-06-19","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-06-19/"}}
