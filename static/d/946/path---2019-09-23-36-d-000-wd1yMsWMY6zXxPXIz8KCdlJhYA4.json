{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Another month and another unexpected hospitalization. Thank god it wasn't Auri, but I'm feeling worn thin by all of the health care navigation this year. My father was sick enough to spend over a week in a hospital bed, and I made the decision to head to New York and help him after a discouraging phone call with his infectious disease specialist. I believe it was the fourth hospital I'd been to in a month, so I'm wracking up experience points at getting attention and answers. I don't know what the hell I'm doing, but fortunately neither does anybody else. The game seems to be about recognizing when you're getting ignored and understanding just enough to trigger a more thoughtful dialogue. You can't really do anything about the shitty system, but you can command a little more attention than you'd be getting otherwise. It sucks, but you can make it a little better for yourself or others by not taking anything for granted. Especially at a hospital, the doctors and nurses are busy, tired, and over-extended. Don't take it for granted that they're giving you the best care. They know what they're saying, but they're tired and work in a high stress environment. A few days ago I came across some notes that worked their way out of some drawer or junk pile of mine. In January, when we had no idea what was going on, I spent sleepless nights researching the long list of spinal fluid tests that were pending for Auri. I was trying to understand what each of them were for, what diseases they might detect, and what the prognosis might be. Of course I didn't solve any mysteries, and I was horrified writing things like \"prognosis poor\", \"few years,\" \"progressive.\" But, I also wrote things like \"HSCT curative if performed early.\" Would you care to guess how or why I got Auri to doctor Kurtzberg so early? Nobody will advocate for you better than yourself. Stay on top of things. It might be important and make a difference.</p>\n<p>Before I dive into family updates, I feel like it's important to share that Natalie had written a blog post while I was away. After talking together about its tone, we decided to not publish it. However, I would be remiss if I didn't explore her thoughts and give them some attention because anybody in her position might feel the same way. She has been in a lot of pain; we both have, on and off throughout the year. Sometimes that pain has been directed outward, toward and against friends or family members, in part because we have nowhere else to direct it. We feel disappointment, some shame, and gratitude for our relationships and interactions. But, when we're feeling anxious, which I'm certain will continue intermittently for a long time, we feel angry. I'm sure that everyone has attended a funeral. Do you remember the awkwardness of it all? What are you supposed to say? \"I'm sorry for your loss,\" seems to be the standard. But what does it really mean? It means you don't know what to say and you don't know what the other party wants to hear. From my perspective, the distraught probably doesn't even know what they want to hear and it likely changes with their mood. Well, we were the distraught, only recently downgraded to <em>overwhelmed</em>. And in all this time, I've wanted lots of sympathy, more than I've received. When I'm at the playground, I actually hope people will ask me about Auri so I can tell them about what's happened. They never do, and then I feel kind of ashamed for wishing it in the first place. The emotions are complicated. I know that Natalie feels complicated; she's always been complicated. So, have you acknowledged how hard she's working? How much acknowledgement is enough? How much is too much? There's this <em>really</em> fine, fuzzy line between celebrating her strength and being sorrowful. And what about Auri? How should you treat her? She's smart and painfully aware of her limitations. Don't talk to her like she's mentally challenged, but don't overdo it either. Maybe it's just too complicated and it's easier to keep your distance. But, we'll notice that too, won't we? You probably can't get it right, and there probably isn't a right way to handle it. So, the way I see it you have two choices. You can disconnect from us or join us on this wild ride. As much as we'd like to, we're not going to be getting off anytime soon. It's making us a little crazy, so my recommendation would be to try and act normal. Normal is all we've been begging for.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/0b236/bellytime.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Belly Time\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/77ab3/bellytime.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/2a211/bellytime.jpg 150w,\n/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/3064f/bellytime.jpg 300w,\n/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/77ab3/bellytime.jpg 600w,\n/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/3cffb/bellytime.jpg 900w,\n/static/d84b8c8380bcba944f245f969aa6d2c2/0b236/bellytime.jpg 1020w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/d4846/bugfest.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.27239488117002%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Bugfest 2019\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/77ab3/bugfest.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/2a211/bugfest.jpg 150w,\n/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/3064f/bugfest.jpg 300w,\n/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/77ab3/bugfest.jpg 600w,\n/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/3cffb/bugfest.jpg 900w,\n/static/8e9d95af91c647922ba07b52cf2f400a/d4846/bugfest.jpg 1094w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I'm sharing a lot of videos this month. In case you didn't know, they open up as an animation but if you click on the image it will play the full video. I like to keep these as a historical record, so we have something to snapshot changes over time. There isn't too much significantly different from last month, but I continue to believe we're watching Auri grow and catch up. It seems like I always write these updates after a good, strong week or two that's inevitably followed by a slow and concerning couple of weeks. Auri seems to have this cadence, two strong weeks, three slow ones. It might be that she (or all of us) develop a mild cold. It may be that she's not sleeping well; she's erupting a bunch of teeth at the same time. I'm told by her neurologist that it's fairly normal for people with brain injuries to experience transient fatigue like this. The term is recrudescence. Still, it's hard to watch and takes us to the  of sanity each time. A week after I post a video of her standing and walking with only one arm for support, Auri will be tired and floppy. She was worn out at the start of this month. This week we're back on track. I feel great right now, but I'm prepared to tense up any day now.</p>\n<p>First, I want to commend Natalie for the grueling, frustrating, but necessary work she puts in every day. Natalie gets discouraged with the lack of progress, but she has managed to keep the proper mindset that this is about putting in the work. For example, she gets Auri in this walker every day and makes her take at least a few steps on her own even though she hates it. Natalie pushes Auri to try, especially in situations that Auri finds difficult, always encouraging her to reach. You have to put in the work and \"keep plugging away.\" This is about endurance and persistence. The gains, if any, won't be realized for years; but Natalie keeps the faith and Auri working.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/2FTRdwRaDV1sziAM8\">Hard work walking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/9xqDtzU9evheDSUV7\">Crawling board</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/FTf3EXhfPku9LpwB7\">Pendulum swinging</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/GSdwhuUtwFuhTna29\">An obstacle course</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/0b236/mommy.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"With mommy\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/77ab3/mommy.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/2a211/mommy.jpg 150w,\n/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/3064f/mommy.jpg 300w,\n/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/77ab3/mommy.jpg 600w,\n/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/3cffb/mommy.jpg 900w,\n/static/a760af30428375764b032e92f1f8821a/0b236/mommy.jpg 1020w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>We had a little bit of a weight scare recently. Auri didn't gain any weight between her August and September appointments. We don't know if it's significant, but the last time this happened things were spiraling out of control. She's getting like 6 teeth at once, though, and she might have been a little sick. She's also getting bigger and it's taking a little longer to feed her.

It's an obvious sign to us that she's all there mentally. She might need a little development and maturation of her humor, but here's a sense of what she's been doing. Sitting on the porch with Natalie during the day, Auri was asked \"where's Lennox?\" Natalie was trying to get her to practice new sign language, \"school\" and \"work\"; and Auri answered (with her hands), \"work.\" \"Do you mean school?\" Natalie asked. Auri shook her head no, \"work. work. work. work.\" \"Lennox is at work?\" Natalie questioned, and Auri broke into a huge giggle. \"Noooooo;\" she was just being silly and getting a kick out of herself. This morning, while I was feeding her breakfast, I was engaging this dancing, spooky halloween tree toy my mom gave us. Auri liked the song it sang but I turned it around because she was a little nervous about the moving face. We kept playing the song while she ate, and at one point I asked her if she wanted me to play it again. \"No. No. No.\" she kept shaking her head and muttering. \"You don't want me to play it?\" \"No.\" \"Are you kidding?\" And, then she broke into laughter, \"yes.\" She was kidding and thrilled with herself at the misdirection.</p>\n<p>We're trying to get an evaluation by the neuropsychology group soon to figure out the exact extent of Auri's developmental delays. I think they usually do this for children with autism or behavioral issues, but they can evaluate her mentally, physically, emotionally, etc. I had to fill out a big questionnaire that was mostly irrelevant for her age, but I did this word list where I circled the words that she <em>uses</em> (not just understands). It's complicated because a lot of her noises and signs are far from complete or recognizable, but I circled those that she tries to use and that she connects correctly.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/0b236/words.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Word list\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/77ab3/words.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/2a211/words.jpg 150w,\n/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/3064f/words.jpg 300w,\n/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/77ab3/words.jpg 600w,\n/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/3cffb/words.jpg 900w,\n/static/6195006cb9238913167c211243297d9b/0b236/words.jpg 1020w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/0c704/brothers.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Brothers\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/77ab3/brothers.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/2a211/brothers.jpg 150w,\n/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/3064f/brothers.jpg 300w,\n/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/77ab3/brothers.jpg 600w,\n/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/3cffb/brothers.jpg 900w,\n/static/400ab8d755f73992e9efa7fcfcdae3d9/0c704/brothers.jpg 981w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I don't feel like I have it in me this month to talk enough about Max and Lennox. I recently took Max to an ENT for the third time this year to follow up about an enlarged lymph node in his neck. After finding out he's dropped from the 70th to the 30th percentile in weight over the course of a year, I've been more than stressed. I'm assured that there's nothing concerning about the lymph node and that there are other explanations for his poor weight gain. It's possible that he and Lennox have been experiencing their own kind of stress. Which brings me to Lennox, my clever and courageous child happens to be my most headstrong. He started elementary school recently, and I'm glad that he's enjoying it so much. I was afraid it would be another source of conflict because we seem to already have so many.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/UcMJNMACkf1VBt449\">Max and Lennox playing outside</a>.
