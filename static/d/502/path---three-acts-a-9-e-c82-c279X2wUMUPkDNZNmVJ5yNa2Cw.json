{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Prologue</h2>\n<p>Just before Auri was born, we found ourselves in a bit of disarray as a family. I clearly remember rising tensions with Lennox, who was working out being a two year old with a pregnant mother. I was wrapping up a project at work that caused me a lot of stress. And, I think we just felt a little overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<h2>Act One</h2>\n<p>I can't recall when it started, but Natalie and I had concerns about Auri for a long time. I think we always felt sensitive about how different she developed from her brothers. If Max and Lennoxhad learned something early, Auuri had learned it late. She always learned the skills in time, though, before it seemed prudent to have concerns. If we brought it up, somebody would remind us that \"girls are just different.\" They might have been right. We'll never know. However, something felt different around her first birthday. Auri had been pulling up, but not  really scooting. She stood on one of her ankles funny, and we had discussed bringing it up at her one year checkup with the pediatrician. Coincidentally, at that appointment in the middle  of November our doctor shared that she scored low on a parent questionnaire about her gross motor development. It was concerning, but it happens sometimes. Given that everything else seemed to be continuing alright, we left thinking it might be a fluke.</p>\n<h3>The Event?</h3>\n<p>Two days before Christmas, on December 23rd, Auri woke up with a reasonably high fever (I think it was > 102). She had slept through the night, but we could tell she wasn't feeling well. I sat in bed that morning and played her some music. She sat patiently, but looked distracted.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6effb/guitar.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.97231450719822%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"December 23rd\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/77ab3/guitar.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/2a211/guitar.jpg 150w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/3064f/guitar.jpg 300w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/77ab3/guitar.jpg 600w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/3cffb/guitar.jpg 900w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6ea5c/guitar.jpg 1200w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/119d7/guitar.jpg 1800w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6effb/guitar.jpg 1806w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>By Christmas morning, we all fell ill.

I remember feeling like something was wrong, but not knowing how acute it was until seeing their daughter  run around and chase the boys. Auri could barely crawl around and play with toys. Something wasn't right, and Natalie and I both knew it. By the week of January 1st, we felt like something was seriously wrong and we had to take action. Natalie phoned our pediatrician and asked for a followup. During the visit, Auri weighed in at <em>exactly</em> the same weight that she had a month and have prior, and her \"slowness\" as the doctor described it prompted a call to Duke pediatric neurology for advice. The neurologist on call <em>strongly</em> recommended we bring her to the emergency room to expedite testing. A normal appointment and consultation might take weeks. We really weren't sure what to do.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, we wrestled with the idea of waiting. But after reviewing old pictures and videos, we realized that what had thought was some kind of delay had unequivocally become developmental regression. We made plans to take her first thing Monday morning, and I drafted a paper with dates and milestones to provide to the doctors. At this point, she could barely sit up. In August, she was crawling around with her cousins. So much had changed so fast.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/5528f/sitting_january.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 108.44645550527905%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Trying to Sit in January\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/04ac7/sitting_january.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/46aea/sitting_january.png 150w,\n/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/57e21/sitting_january.png 300w,\n/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/04ac7/sitting_january.png 600w,\n/static/81f71cc3802c2e72168ac6fbe852fed3/5528f/sitting_january.png 663w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h3>An Emergency Room Visit</h3>\n<p>Natalie hopped in the van with Auri just as soon as she woke up and rushed to Duke.

I had fears that Auri might be suffering muscular dystrophy, and I kept asking about certain tests. Before we had any updates or answers, I was forced to leave Natalie behind and head home to pick up Max. Still at the hospital, Natalie had to manage entertaining an infant through all the commotion. Without remembering the exactt</p>\n<p>I don't remember who helped put Max and Lennox to bed that night (it might have been Dan), but  after getting them ready, I hopped back into the car to drive to the hospital. On the way, Natalie sent me a \"where are you, hurry up\" kind of message. I just knew it meant she had something to share and I called her back. Somehow, one of residents had committed a faux pas and read Natalie an excerpt of the preliminary MRI report. Natalie told me that they thought it was a leukodystrophy. I didn't know what that meant, but I almost crashed my car after I looked it up on the highway. Everything went dark.</p>\n<h2>Act Two - Shit Hits the Fan</h2>\n<p>As I stumbled through the hospital trying to make it back to Natalie and Auri, I had to stop and compose myself multiple times. I kept fearing I was going to faint, and my knees were so weak that I kind of awkwardly fell through the hallways. On the verge of a breakdown, I spotted Natalie's sister in front of me and barely choked out her name. A somber hug and an almost run to the hospital room brought me to them unbearably slow. Natalie sat on the bed, trying to keep Auri calm. It just didn't  look much different than earlier that day, except that they were both exhausted. Auri had to be sedated for her MRI, and she had been poked and prodded and was not making anything easy. After a sleepless night at home and a return to Natalie and  Auri at the hospital, I found myself struggling through the halls again. When I reached the room, I found that they had been taken to prep for a lumbar puncture to draw spinal fluid for testing. Two nurses offered to walk me to them, but I really needed more to carry me.</p>\n<p>On what I believe was the same day, Auri's neurologist spoke with us before discharge and explained that the MRI indicated \"abnormal white matter changes concerning for leukodystrophy of unknown etiology.\" In what was my first brush with seemingly paradoxical statements about Auri's health, she told us that it was a good catch by the resident radiologist because the abnormalities were hard to spot. It meant that we caught it early. Something about how that was phrased seemed absurd to me, but I still had at least one foot out the door and a toe dipped in denial. How could I accept what I was being told? I really waivered emotionally, without finding a whole lot of stable ground. I couldn't quite accept what was happening, but everything was still terrifying. As Natalie got Auri ready to leave, I spoke with the residents and attending about discharge. It was another moment in a month of absurdities. As I sat in a chair in the hallway, they asked me if I understood what was happening and what our next steps were. I calmly explained that I understood that my daughter was dying, and that we were to keep her comfortable and enjoy whatever time with her that we had left. I can remember the pain in their faces and their uncertainty about how to end the conversation. At least one looked like she wanted to give me a hug but she must have thought twice about it because they left with that sort of awkward, backward shuffle that people do when they want to get away from a difficult situation. I left to pick up Max from school, relieved that Natalie was on my heels with Auri.</p>\n<h3>Maybe It's Nothing</h3>\n<p>\"Maybe it's nothing,\" I kept telling myself. Everyone I spoke with tried to remind me to remain positive and hopeful. \"Maybe it's nothing,\" I lied to myself. The day after we left the hospital, we actually took everyone to Dave and Buster's. I had been taking the boys there somewhat regularly as a treat for good behavior. Natalie and I wanted to do something as a family, and since Auri had never been, we thought it might be the perfect activity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"./dave_busters.jpg\">Dave and Busters</a></p>\n<p>Given the insanity of the preview few days, we found relief and had a lot of fun. I thought that if we could do stuff like this together, it might not be so bad. \"Maybe it's nothing,\" I thought again. Or, if it <em>was</em> something, maybe it would turn out alright.</p>\n<h3>It Definitely Looks like Something</h3>\n<p>We were referred to follow up with a neuro-ophthalmologist to determine if Auri had any damage to her optic nerve that might help with a differential diagnosis. While she was a nice woman, I felt that she was a bit aloof. With a clap and a proclamation of \"good news\" she told us that Auri's optic nerve looked fine. It was <em>good news</em> because damage might have been a sign of \"one of the bad ones.\" That struck me in such an awkwardly painful way that I stared to tear up. \"Are you okay, sir?\" she asked and actually handed me a lollipop. \"Am I okay?\" It was such a strange thought to think that there was good news, or that she had just given me some. It was what I came to understand (and describe later) as a relativism that continued and grew stranger with every appointment. However, the lollipop did make me feel better.</p>\n<h3>Reaching Out</h3>\n<p>The next day, on Friday, January 11th, I sent an e-mail to Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg about her <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02254863\">clinical trial</a> introducing umbilical cord blood in advance of bone marrow transplantantion. I had hoped that we could get Auri prepared for whatever might be necessary by finding the right contacts. A portion of what I wrote her:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we receive confirmation that Auri is experiencing the onset of a late infantile leukodystrophy, I would like to be in a position to offer her options. I'm sure you know that the rate of progression of these diseases in infants can make HSCT inadvisable, and I'm hopeful that your trial may provide an avenue for treatment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To my surprise, she asked to take a look at Auri's case and, by the end of the weekend, had scheduled us to meet in clinic the following week. We drew some blood samples to do HLA typing (to find a donor match). From what I remember as an afterthought, she suggested we order Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). The results of some of the blood and spinal fluid tests had already ruled out some of the more common  leukodystrophies, and Dr. K said something to the effect of \"whatever this is, WES will tell us faster than anything else.\" She and her team were to see about getting it rushed. This meeting and that decision proved to be <em>critical</em>.</p>\n<h3>A Diagnosis</h3>\n<p>The preliminary genetic report was made available to our neurologist relatively soon thereafter. I believe it had taken 10 days. I knew that the results were available because I had been in contact with the laboratory, but when I tried to get information from our doctor, she requested that we meet her the following day. Obviously, I couldn't sleep that night. I was <em>pissed</em> then and now that we were made to wait, but I think our doctor needed the time to do research. Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome is rare, and I can't imagine she felt comfortable discussing it with me without having time to figure out what it meant and what our options were. When we finally did meet, it was clear that there really weren't any. I was handed a few research articles that I devoured on the way home that gave me some hope.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These observations are important because they suggest that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Treatment in the early stages of the disease might result in attenuation of the associated inflammation and consequent tissue damage</li>\n<li>It might be possible to discontinue treatments after the subacute encephalopathic period subsides</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898548/\">\"Therapies in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome\"</a> Y J Crow, A Vanderver, S Orcesi, T W Kuijpers, and G I Rice. 2013</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Frantic Research</h3>\n<h2>Act Three -</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Three Act Narrative","date":"2019-04-06","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/three-acts/"}}
