Natalie's sister and mother were kind enough to take Max and Lennox to the movie theater with their cousins, but by the end of the day I heard that the cousins tested positive for Strep A at the doctor. Unsurprisingly, Lennox woke up the following day complaining that his throat hurt. Although he tested negative (maybe because it was too soon), both he and Max developed rashes and sores and complained about not feeling well for over a week. Like every time prior, Natalie and I did our best to keep everyone separated. And like every time prior, I ended up sick too. This time, however, I was the only one to get a fever. I laid in bed for a few days wondering what the hell has happened to us. We just keep getting sick. I've been told it's the stress, and I believe it.</p>\n<h2>Fruit Harvest</h2>\n<p>This spring was supposed to be the year that I finally finished my master piece garden. That didn't quite work out, but thankfully the fruit trees don't care! They've been digging roots for over five years and mostly take care of themselves.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/f87f3/peaches.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.271375464684%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"peaches\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/77ab3/peaches.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/2a211/peaches.jpg 150w,\n/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/3064f/peaches.jpg 300w,\n/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/77ab3/peaches.jpg 600w,\n/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/3cffb/peaches.jpg 900w,\n/static/37db6987b89bcb8e81d905d5b2821719/f87f3/peaches.jpg 1076w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>We snagged a few freezer bags worth of peaches that made their way into some unofficial Howling Cow ice cream, courtesy of our friends.
