{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>About two years ago we went out on a limb and started Auri on a drug that we knew very little about. It turned out to be a wildly successful decision, although we'll never really know what might have happened if we had not. But in the following couple of years, I've read, watched, and learned a great deal more about this disease that seems to lurk in her, waiting for its next opportunity to strike. While many children with circumstances similar to Auri appear to be doing well, avoiding relapse, and developing strength and skills, more than a few have suffered setbacks. This immune disease can be devious, showing hardly any signs or no signs at all. Lab tests come up negative, doctors hesitate, and all the while a child suffers slow but steady brain damage. The only warning is weakness, fatigue; but these are normal parts of caring for a disabled child. When you realize that it's gone on for too long and that something is actually wrong, the damage is done. If we're vigilant and assertive we might be able to respond to the emergency quickly, but we can only hope to minimize the losses, stem the tide.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your child is being asked to take part in this expanded access program of treatment with\nHuman Cord Tissue Mesenchymal Stromal cells (hCT-MSCs) because your child has\nAicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) which has only partially responded to the only\navailable therapy.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"A New Hope","date":"2021-04-20","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-20/"}}
