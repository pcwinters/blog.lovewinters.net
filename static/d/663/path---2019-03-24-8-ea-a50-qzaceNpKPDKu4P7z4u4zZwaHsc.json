{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In the past and with mixed success, I've fought my tendency to withdraw into my privacy. A good friend once described me as \"insular,\" and, admittedly, I'm an introvert that prefers the predictability and control of my personal space. For over two months, unfortunately, that space has been a veritable nightmare: dreadful, unpredictable, and painful. Thus far I've resisted the urge to engage in self pity, trying, rather, to focus on exhausting all options for saving my daughter. But what left is there for me to do and how am I to feel now? Where do I direct my attention and from what well can I draw strength? We're alone, committed to an obscured path, inaccessible to most; and there's nothing more we can do. We move through the dark, hoping to protect our daughter, a journey without a destination. Consequently, my personal space has been transformed into an enduring emotional struggle; and I'm tired. Yet I've been forced to come to terms these past two weeks with the insecurity that plagues our family now and forever. And, the feeling of being apart has built tremendously since my last update. How do I answer a polite question like \"how are you today?\" Can I share how I really feel? Should I? With every friend, coworker, and family member, I'm forced to politely withold. Is this real stoicism? The truth is too difficult. This must be why support groups exist.</p>\n<p>You might wonder why I'm writing like this now. Well, I get asked often how Natalie and I are doing. I don't speak for Natalie, but I know she can relate to much of what I'm sharing. Still, I'm never confident that I can really answer the question on her behalf because I can't answer it on mine. Without exaggeration, I can tell you that my feelings change every hour. I swing between grief, fear, and gratitude: grief for my daughter and the changes in our lives, fear that it may still get worse, and gratitude for her opportunity to achieve a semi-normal life. As I watch Auri fluctuate, through colds, infections, and fatigue, I reckon with all of this, sometimes within an interval of a few minutes. Imagine living on a world experiencing earthquakes with the same period. You'd be in a state of constant panic. How would you deal? Could you go on a date and keep from crying at the bar?</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/fa0a8/happy_couple.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.97348886532343%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"happy_couple.jpg\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/77ab3/happy_couple.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/2a211/happy_couple.jpg 150w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/3064f/happy_couple.jpg 300w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/77ab3/happy_couple.jpg 600w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/3cffb/happy_couple.jpg 900w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/6ea5c/happy_couple.jpg 1200w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/119d7/happy_couple.jpg 1800w,\n/static/4ba29a9748573c1542e8213e32ef9019/fa0a8/happy_couple.jpg 1886w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>There's no end, and this </p>\n<hr>\n<p>You don't read these updates to hear me complain about </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Anxiety","date":"2019-03-24","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-03-24/"}}
