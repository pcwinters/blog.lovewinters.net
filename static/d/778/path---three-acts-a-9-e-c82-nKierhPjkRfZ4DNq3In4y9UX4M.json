{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Prologue</h2>\n<p>Just before Auri was born, we found ourselves in a bit of disarray as a family. I clearly remember rising tensions with Lennox, who was working out being a two year old with a pregnant  mother. </p>\n<p>...</p>\n<h2>Act One</h2>\n<p>I can't recall when it started, but Natalie and I had concerns about Auri for a long time. I think we always felt sensitive about how different she developed from her brothers. If Max and Lennoxhad learned something early, Auuri had learned it late. She always learned the skills in time, though, before it seemed prudent to have concerns. If we brought it up, somebody would remind us that \"girls are just different.\" They might have been right. We'll never know. However, something felt different around her first birthday. Auri had been pulling up, but not  really scooting. She stood on one of her ankles funny, and we had discussed bringing it up at her one year checkup with the pediatrician. Coincidentally, at that appointment in the middle  of November our doctor shared that she scored low on a parent questionnaire about her gross motor development. It was concerning, but it happens sometimes. Given that everything else seemed to be continuing alright, we left thinking it might be a fluke.</p>\n<p>Before Christmas, we all got sick. Two days before, on December 23rd, Auri woke up with a reasonably high fever (I think it was > 102). She had slept through the night, but we could tell she wasn't feeling well. I sat in bed that morning and played her some music. She sat patiently, but looked distracted.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6effb/guitar.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.97231450719822%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEBf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFdOe8biYb/xAAaEAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAwEREyES/9oACAEBAAEFAte6WIeKVTBEZWMM5//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAEDAQE/AUf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAgEBPwFX/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBISIxQXH/2gAIAQEABj8CooykUv04jR//xAAaEAADAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMVFh/9oACAEBAAE/IeMXfBpnqZ5R3kNHR7EGpPH4X1Z//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCjz//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAgBAwEBPxBC3f/EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAECAQE/EEP/xAAcEAEAAwEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRYYH/2gAIAQEAAT8QyC2ArivP7AilkxFyIPX6LkxA2xp3sVF6CdfU9yv1GWs//9k='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"December 23rd\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/77ab3/guitar.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/2a211/guitar.jpg 150w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/3064f/guitar.jpg 300w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/77ab3/guitar.jpg 600w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/3cffb/guitar.jpg 900w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6ea5c/guitar.jpg 1200w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/119d7/guitar.jpg 1800w,\n/static/5c5668c2db3600cd2bb7af57c84d37df/6effb/guitar.jpg 1806w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>By Christmas  morning, </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/eda68/emergency_room.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.33333333333331%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Emergency Room\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/77ab3/emergency_room.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/2a211/emergency_room.jpg 150w,\n/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/3064f/emergency_room.jpg 300w,\n/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/77ab3/emergency_room.jpg 600w,\n/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/3cffb/emergency_room.jpg 900w,\n/static/2fbcc43e5ecdcdaf2b247ae373cb28fe/eda68/emergency_room.jpg 1089w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>I don't remember who helped put Max and Lennox to bed that night (it might have been Dan), but  after getting them ready, I hopped back into the car to drive to the hospital. On the way, Natalie sent me a \"where are you, hurry up\" kind of message. I just knew it meant she had something to share and I called her back. Somehow, one of residents had made a mistake and read portions of the preliminary MRI report</p>\n<h2>Act Two - Shit Hits the Fan</h2>\n<p>As I stumbled through the hospital trying to make it to Natalie and Auri, I had to stop and compose myself multiple times. I kept fearing I was going to faint, and my knees were so weak I kind of awkwardly fell through the hallways. On the verge of a breakdown, I spotted Natalie's sister in front of me and barely choked out her name. A quick hug and an almost run to the room brought me to them. Natalie sat on the bed, trying to keep Auri calm. I understand now how exhausted they both must have been. Auri had to be sedated for her MRI, and she had been poked and prodded  </p>\n<p>The next day, . Auri's neurologist MRI indicated \"abnormal white matter changes concerning for leukodystrophy of uknown etiology.\"</p>\n<p>We were referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist, to determine if Auri had any damage to her optic nerve that might help with a differential diagnosis. While she was a nice woman, I felt that she was a bit aloof. With a clap and \"good news\" she told us that the optic nerve was fine. It was good news because that might be a sign of \"one of the bad ones.\" That struck me in the most awkwardly painful way that I stared to tear. \"Are you okay, sir?\" she asked and handed me a lollipop. \"Am I okay?\" It was such a strange thought to think that there was good news, or that she had just given me some. It was what I came to understand (and relate to others) as a relativism that continued and grew stranger with every appointment.</p>\n<p>The next day, on Friday, January 11th, I sent an e-mail to Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg about her <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02254863\">clinical trial</a> introducing umbilical cord blood in advance of bone marrow transplantantion. I had hoped that we could get Auri prepared for whatever might be necessary by finding the right contacts. A portion of what I wrote her:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we receive confirmation that Auri is experiencing the onset of a late infantile leukodystrophy, I would like to be in a position to offer her options. I'm sure you know that the rate of progression of these diseases in infants can make HSCT inadvisable, and I'm hopeful that your trial may provide an avenue for treatment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To my surprise, she asked to take a look at Auri's case and, by the end of the weekend, had scheduled us to meet in clinic the following week. We drew some blood samples to do HLA typing (to find a donor match). From what I remember, as an afterthought she suggested we order Whole  Exome Sequencing.</p>\n<h2>Act Three -</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Three Act Narrative","date":"2019-04-06","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/three-acts/"}}
