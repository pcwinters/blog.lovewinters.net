{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Another URI</h2>\n<p>We always watch our children get sick in sequence. Two weeks ago, Max had a bad cough. The following weekend, Lennox woke us up in the middle of night with another bout of croup. This week past week was Auri's turn, and we were incredibly nervous given the consequences of previous illnesses. We happened to be traveling to and staying in Philadelphia as it peaked, and despite notable restlessness, fatigue, and irritability, there haven't appeared to be significant changes in her condition. I might say that she got slowed down a bit, but not to an extent that has me worried about recovery.

In a way, I feel like we're treading open water, one storm away from going under. Although she's still able to eat solids and drink purees, Auri can't swallow liquid water. Any further loss of swallowing coordination or an episode of dehydration might necessitate a feeding tube. For me, this represents a cliff that we're trying to scramble back from. With any luck (and good health) she may regain a lot of that ability, and we have an X-Ray based swallow study to assess her next week.</p>\n<h2>Visit with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)</h2>\n<p>On Thursday, we had a long appointment at CHOP with a team and doctor that are recognized as the country's experts in AGS. They're also the group experimenting with and prescribing the drug for AGS patients that we've managed to secure locally. Although the travel was difficult for us and Auri, I think the information we received and the relationship we established made it worthwhile.
