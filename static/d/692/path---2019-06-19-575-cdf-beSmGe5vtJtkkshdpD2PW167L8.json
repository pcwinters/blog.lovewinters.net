{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The 15th of June marked four months of Aurelia's treatment with Baricitinib. When this started, we were given the expectation that it might take this long to know whether Auri would tolerate this drug and respond to it favorably. Since she began treatment, we've been to Duke every two weeks and subjected her to constant blood draws and lab work. Well, it <em>has</em> gone well enough and we're celebrating this milestone and spacing out her followups moving forward. My understanding of her condition and my expectations and hopes for the future have changed constantly.</p>\n<h2>Weathering Storms</h2>\n<p>In December, Auri failed to bounce back from a febrile illness. We believe this precipitated her decline, and research into her disease seems to support this as a plausible trigger. Through January and February, it seemed like we couldn't shake our constantly recurring colds, each coinciding with some loss of skill or increased difficulty of Auri's. For that reason, we've been anxious every time one of our kids gets sick. We don't know whether another illness could cause a disease flare, but thankfully we haven't observed one. In the past four months, Auri has had a few colds, some severe, some less so. This past month, we had three consecutive weekends where one of our kids was sick with a fever. Max, in fact, peaked at 104Â° F in the middle of the night. We weren't able to keep Auri from getting sick, but she was spared what Max and Lennox experienced (sleeping in the bathroom, chills, etc). However, she developed an eye infection for the second time, this episode less serious than the first time it happened in March.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 74.98776309348997%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAQL/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABzqaidGCxP//EABsQAQABBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMSEyEi/9oACAEBAAEFAtkpeS16DERn/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBH/2gAIAQMBAT8Bh//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABECER/9oACAEBAAY/AjrmGqf/xAAcEAEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABExUUFhcYH/2gAIAQEAAT8hOkcCNubZ9IqOS51NmOCUX7P/2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEDTP/8QAFxEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIf/aAAgBAwEBPxACcsL/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIUH/2gAIAQIBAT8Quq//xAAbEAEBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAxIVFhQf/aAAgBAQABPxDXGvrikUWWR6MQWiXtmcI6h0fXA5avLo94wgNlSGf/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Conjunctivitis\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/2a211/infection.jpg 150w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3064f/infection.jpg 300w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/77ab3/infection.jpg 600w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/3cffb/infection.jpg 900w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/6ea5c/infection.jpg 1200w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/119d7/infection.jpg 1800w,\n/static/2810702637eb5e57e8b18875dc83de3c/b820d/infection.jpg 2043w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>The positive in this is that Auri <em>has</em> gotten sick, no more or less severely so than in the past. And, She's done <em>fine</em>. We don't know if that will always be the case, but it's a promising sign that either the drug is working or that she's in some kind of remission. I'm speculating here, but I think the illness that really triggered her disease was \"mono\" (EBV or mononucleosis). Most people contract the virus by adulthood, but she tested positive in February at a year old. It's a nasty virus that makes your immune system go a bit nuts and then stays latent in your cells for the remainder of your life. You fight it for a few months after the initial infection, which might roughly align with Auri's period of decline and stabilization. I hope that she never experiences a relapse, but maybe this is a sign that it would take something more than the common cold to cause her issues.</p>\n<h2>Developments</h2>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>At some point in February when I was frantically trying to find a doctor that would treat Auri, I had spoken to some parents of affected children. One asked me, referring to Auri, something like, \"what skills does she still have?\" That hit me so unexpectedly and indescribably. I wasn't in denial exactly, but my daughter went from being 100% normal to significantly disabled in the course of just a few weeks and she was gettnig worse. Everything happened so quickly that I'm not entirely confident that I can objectively say how bad things really were. And, Natalie and I remember things a little differently. My recollection isn't perfect, but I did keep a journal that tells me that things are only <em>qualitatively</em> different than February. </p>\n<p>So to calibrate, on February 12th I wrote the following.</p>\n<p><strong>2/15 Positives:</strong> Understood new word balloon. Bringing spoon to mouth to feed herself. Signalling with head nods and pointing. Socially engaged. Loud cry, voice, and cough.</p>\n<p><strong>2/15 Negatives:</strong> Difficulty with and refusing water. Less trunk strength, not sitting up when carried. Less head strength, leaning when eating. Trouble getting arm out from under when rolling over. Exaggerated startle.</p>\n<p>Today, you can watch her <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/gfnQrzE8iC5moMPD7\">walking in the Hallway</a>, <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/NLPoxrj1Xd6pXCLY9\">playing in the grocery cart</a>, and <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/uFspcjRdAFTHAwCw6\">swinging at the playground</a>. You can see for yourself that she has challenges, but many children with her disease would find these activities impossible. </p>\n<p>I'm not sure what, but it says something that I celebrated her clear pointing with her index finger by taking a picture.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/f87f3/pointing.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 133.271375464684%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Pointing\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/77ab3/pointing.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/2a211/pointing.jpg 150w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/3064f/pointing.jpg 300w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/77ab3/pointing.jpg 600w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/3cffb/pointing.jpg 900w,\n/static/4b5a464f47902167e6a964bb6d9fb955/f87f3/pointing.jpg 1076w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h3>Growth</h3>\n<p>Before this chaos <em>really</em> began, we had taken Auri to her pediatrician at the start of the year with our concerns. At that appointment we learned that Auri hadn't gained any weight over the preceding month. That's a bad sign for any child, and for Auri it was a signal that something was terribly wrong. There's a big dip in Auri's weight chart at 15 months, right when shit really hit the fan. This was <em>just</em> before starting treatment, when she was choking on food and water and suffered the worst of her regressions. She was persistently sick and got very thin. She went as low as the 13th percentile. Four months later, she's eating and drinking better and holding the 30th percentile. Within the first few weeks of treatment she became remarkably enthusiastic about eating and quickly regained a lot of weight.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/32209/weight.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 94.87179487179488%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Weight\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/04ac7/weight.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/46aea/weight.png 150w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/57e21/weight.png 300w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/04ac7/weight.png 600w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/878bd/weight.png 900w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/92a79/weight.png 1200w,\n/static/910a67a7ed08e4f362a5863fccaf1959/32209/weight.png 1404w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>This length chart tells a story that only Natalie and I would immediately recognize. You can see how inconsistent the measurements are, and it's a result of how spastic Auri's legs became. It's difficult to measure her length carefully because she has trouble relaxing her feet and legs when she's stressed. You can imagine that she doesn't like laying on a table with people trying to push her. I don't know what this chart will look like in the future, but it's very likely that Auri has suffered some growth delays. I imagine that recovery here would take a bit more time, but I don't think we've observed anything serious.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/32209/length.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 94.58689458689459%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Length\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/04ac7/length.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/46aea/length.png 150w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/57e21/length.png 300w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/04ac7/length.png 600w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/878bd/length.png 900w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/92a79/length.png 1200w,\n/static/8faac885c6dff7529a2c48321b8ec178/32209/length.png 1404w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Auri's First Milestone","date":"2019-06-19","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-06-19/"}}
