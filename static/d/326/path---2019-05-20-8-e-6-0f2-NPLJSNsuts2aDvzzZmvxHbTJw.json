Both Natalie and I scrutinize everything Auri does, so this decreasing enthusiasm caused a great deal of anxiety and panic in us. We've developed doubts about Auri's trajectory, and we've been worried about backsliding.</p>\n<h2>Keeping Steady</h2>\n<p>Objectively, though, I think she's still improving, just slowly.
