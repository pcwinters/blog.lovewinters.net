We're still eagerly anticipating a stem cell therapy for Auri this year, and, in order to measure its effects, Auri will needs baseline and post-treatment MRIs of her brain. We expect FDA approval soon. Unfortunately, we had to reschedule the baseline MRI in December due to the illness I previously wrote about and yesterday because we let Auri drink an ounce of apple juice 30 minutes after the cutoff time. So, to the mistake and consequences. The mistake seems so minor an innocent. We focused on the need to stop eating many hours beforehand, but failed to internalize the stop time for fluids. The consequence may be a delay in this therapy that we have hopes for. The odds seem high that she'll be sick again in two weeks when we retry and that we'll have to reschedule and delay again. We have no idea if any of this will be of consequence, but we're both really angry at ourselves for the mistake. In this and in other ways, Natalie and I place ourselves under an extreme amount of pressure to maximize Auri's therapy and recovery. And, in this and in other ways, we have little to no understanding of how consequential our efforts will be. The pressure has resulted in, for me at least, an emotional bankruptcy that requires a restructuring. Out of necessity, I'm forced to start adjusting how I think about Auri and her future. The bottom line is that Auri has been remarkably stable and consistent. She's developing; not as quickly as we had hoped, but straightforwardly like a child with cerebral palsy of similar severity. This year will have to be different for us, in that we need to stop sprinting and start training for the marathon. We're raising a child with disabilities, and we'll need to develop more endurance to maintain a happy and healthy family.</p>\n<h2>Updates</h2>\n<p>The past few weeks have been a little tricky but everything has been mostly good since my last big update in October. Since then, Auri started rolling and army crawling (if we force her to). In November, she started showing more strength and ability in her gait trainer. Through all of this, she's communicating more verbally. She still has significantly delayed and impaired speech, but she's been using new words and putting new sounds together. She has graced us with new words like \"Elmo,\" \"let it go,\" \"walk,\" \"door,\" \"floor,\" \"knock knock,\" \"Olaf,\" \"uh huh\" (for yes). She works hard at finding ways to ask for what she wants, and I'm happy to see her getting better at it.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/fb3c3/stinky_smiles.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Stinky Smiles\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/77ab3/stinky_smiles.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/2a211/stinky_smiles.jpg 150w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/3064f/stinky_smiles.jpg 300w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/77ab3/stinky_smiles.jpg 600w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/3cffb/stinky_smiles.jpg 900w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/6ea5c/stinky_smiles.jpg 1200w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/119d7/stinky_smiles.jpg 1800w,\n/static/e14960257bbcabecb0734f88318b4519/fb3c3/stinky_smiles.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we wrapped up the year in a bit of distress. On Christmas, Natalie and I sent our boys with my mom for a dinner that we had to skip. Auri had a terrible cough that came on after getting past an unrelated and previous febrile illness. It had really upsetting echoes of how this all began last year and came    literally on the same dates. I was a real party pooper on New Year's Eve, but I was just too drained to enjoy myself. The next day we moved to our temporary home (I'll explain later) after struggling to pack up our house in time, and by the end of the week I found another large tumor on our dog Misha. It was removed, thankfully benign; but it set the tone for the year. A few days later I had a surprise birthday party for Natalie and the carousel ride continued. We're also fighting insurance limits and denials for the large number of physical and occupational therapy appointments we maintain, floating a lot of bills until we know what to do. I have a lot to more to say about that now that we're big spenders in the health care system, but I'll keep it short. To hell with it all.</p>\n<h2>Recap of the Last 12 Months</h2>\n<p>It has been about 12 months now, since our lives changed. The really acute, terrifying events of last year occurred between December 2018 and February 2019. That period was traumatizing, and it has had lasting and serious effects on our emotional well being (something I constantly reflect on). The heavy stuff went as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>October 2018, we thought Auri might have an orthopedic problem with her ankle.</li>\n<li>December 2018, Auri never really recovered from an extended illness at Christmas time. We began to worry. She was tired and slow.</li>\n<li>January 3rd, 2018, on her birthday, Natalie took Auri to the pediatrician who decided to call Duke Neurology. They suggested we bring her to the emergency room rather than wait for an out-patient consultation.</li>\n<li>January 7th-8th 2019, Auri had extensive workup at the hospital, including an MRI that suggested a leukodystrophy. The vast majority of these diseases are terminal, and it was my understanding that it would take her life within the year. And, to make matters worse, the inheritance of these diseases put the odds of Max or Lennox having the same close to 50%.</li>\n<li>January 23rd 2019, the last day that Auri crawled on her own.</li>\n<li>January 24th 2019, we received a diagnosis from genetic testing and talked with Auri's neurologist about the lack of treatment options. There was some suggestion in the literature that a particular drug could be helpful, but it wasn't well documented and there wasn't an open clinical trial to join. The literature also gave the impression that, with luck, Auri's regression might stop without taking her life early, although she would be \"devastatingly\" disabled.</li>\n<li>February 7th 2019, we were told that the drug wasn't an option and that we would have to simply hope for the best.</li>\n<li>February 8th 2019, I freaked the fuck out after a scary week and a particularly bad night of Auri not sleeping, crying all the time, and choking while eating and drinking. I contacted everyone I could and starting making demands. I labored over my words and writing, thinking that I would get only one e-mail or call, one shot at making it happen.</li>\n<li>February 13th 2019, day one of her drug therapy 😀.</li>\n<li>March 2019 2019, we travelled to Philadelphia where they've been doing clinical trials. We couldn't do more than guess based on their experiences, but I left with the impression that this therapy could work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frankly, after all that, it's just been a series of over reactions and panic. We've been terrified by every cold, cough, and fever. We've scrutinized every movement, changes in Auri's strength, and all the little details inherent in her treatment and trajectory. After starting the drug, Auri began babbling again almost immediately, she began sleeping better, and she more than made up for the weight she had lost. Where in February she had zero strength when carried, after the drug she began to hold herself upright in our arms. We observed a significant, immediate rebound in the first weeks followed by a slower development more natural for someone with disabilities. I've often answered questions about how Auri's doing with, \"she's doing much better than we are.\" Everyone has been quick to remind me that she seems bigger, stronger, and more mature with every week and month. You've all been right. We (or maybe just I) have been living most of the year with our heads and hearts stuck in the above.</p>\n<h2>The Present and the Coming Year</h2>\n<p>Auri has grown and matured considerably since March. She's no longer a baby and pretty clear about what she wants. She loves to listen to music, especially songs from the Frozen movies. She has elmo, Olaf, Anna, and Elsa dolls that have to go everywhere with her. She's <em>always</em> asking to walk and loves to explore every room and corner. <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/UHfYJynDqenABfFSA\">She loves to dip her french fries in ketchup</a>. She's a funny little girl.</p>\n<h3>Play and Exercise Are One and the Same</h3>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/e577a/playground.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 95.4626334519573%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Playground\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/04ac7/playground.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/46aea/playground.png 150w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/57e21/playground.png 300w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/04ac7/playground.png 600w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/878bd/playground.png 900w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/92a79/playground.png 1200w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/132d8/playground.png 1800w,\n/static/0d272c6bd0ac41b0360b8d7e3023f5f8/e577a/playground.png 2248w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Playing looks a lot like <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/njMPgxqnsfmb1nFE6\">rolling around and singing songs</a> and constant <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/DEBycDe71ZN5U3KH9\">exercise</a>. At Christmas, <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnwFMATLRUEf92ux7\">Auri practiced hard in her gait trainer</a>. She wants to walk constantly, which requires us to hold her hands for support (I'm hoping to get her somewhat independent in her gait trainer soon, because our backs are killing us). She's come a long way since the summer. I remember telling a physical therapist then how proud I was that Auri walked (with my support) \"at least 20 steps around the playground.\" At the time, we were still holding most of her weight with our hands under her armpits. Now we hold her hands or wrists. She still needs a lot of support and correction, but she's holding herself and carrying all of her weight in her legs. We can walk around the house or playground for an hour, easily over 100 steps though I've never counted by how much. In the past month, we all (including the professionals) have noticed smoother stepping. At times, Auri's sort of holding it all together a little better, leaning on us less and taking more natural steps. She has a long way to go, but she still seems determined to get there.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/870ea/gait.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 138.37638376383762%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Gait trainer\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/04ac7/gait.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/46aea/gait.png 150w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/57e21/gait.png 300w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/04ac7/gait.png 600w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/878bd/gait.png 900w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/92a79/gait.png 1200w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/132d8/gait.png 1800w,\n/static/5f4b205bd063f6a0ba5d34d87abe25d9/870ea/gait.png 1897w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Many days we'd love to just plop her in a chair in front of the television, but who are we to deprive her? She's a two year old that wants to explore, and we feel like it's our responsibility to say yes as much as possible. She's dependent on us, and we're determined to give her every opportunity. The therapists all say, \"life is the best therapy;\" and a physiatrist recently told me that being on her feet is better than stretching at helping Auri avoid muscle and joint problems associated with disability. More than once I've been given the soft advice to take it easy or give ourselves a break. We simply can't. Everyone probably feels like they'd do anything for their children. Well, we've been called to task. Natalie and I try to tag in and out as best as possible, but we still burn out. Thank you to everyone that assists with other things in our lives because it helps us maintain enough energy to keep this up. This is just something I'm not yet ready to adjust.</p>\n<h3>Home Remodel</h3>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/db1a5/remodel.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"remodel\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/77ab3/remodel.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/2a211/remodel.jpg 150w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/3064f/remodel.jpg 300w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/77ab3/remodel.jpg 600w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/3cffb/remodel.jpg 900w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/6ea5c/remodel.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/119d7/remodel.jpg 1800w,\n/static/a111e733c756326dc279733a1b827de6/db1a5/remodel.jpg 4048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Right now we're living at my mother's house while our house gets destroyed. For years we've delayed home renovations due to unexpected events and expenses.</p>\n<h3>Health and Well Being</h3>\n<p>Our family has greatly improved in this regard. Max and Lennox seem to be a bit happier, and Natalie and I have been more present and patient. Max and Lennox have demonstrated small but significant adjustments, like playing with Auri and generally being more helpful. I think they're happier because Natalie and I have been more engaged. There's a positive feedback loop, too. The more fun we have together, the more patient we all are with each other. That patience is what has made the difference. Everyone here was in a lot of pain last year.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/fb3c3/kids.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Kiddos\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/77ab3/kids.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/2a211/kids.jpg 150w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/3064f/kids.jpg 300w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/77ab3/kids.jpg 600w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/3cffb/kids.jpg 900w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/6ea5c/kids.jpg 1200w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/119d7/kids.jpg 1800w,\n/static/a3804bdd37a2df25db3599d163d30aa3/fb3c3/kids.jpg 4032w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>As for Natalie and I, we're a bit up and down and in and out. I find myself benefiting a great deal from regular appointments with a counselor. It might sound a little silly, but it's a big deal to me and the family that I was able to start cooking again. We still fall behind on a lot of other chores from lack of motivation, but less and less its because of outright depression. Although we're both oscillating, rarely do we find ourselves struggling at the same time. More likely, one of us picks up the slack for the other. The self-pity has been fading away, and the fatigue (emotional and physical) has been easier to overcome. I don't think that Natalie would be forthcoming about this with many, but it's all true. I don't feel particularly vulnerable about sharing. Rather, I hope that my honesty brings us (and others) some understanding or empathy. This trauma that we've experienced and the difficulty that lies ahead is very isolating. We're wounded, in a way, and asking for help sometimes feels like debasing ourselves. I don't really want to ask anybody for anything, and I'm really grateful when I don't have to.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/e8be6/couple.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Couple\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/77ab3/couple.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/2a211/couple.jpg 150w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/3064f/couple.jpg 300w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/77ab3/couple.jpg 600w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/3cffb/couple.jpg 900w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/6ea5c/couple.jpg 1200w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/119d7/couple.jpg 1800w,\n/static/d784d5a6e709775309be88b5c9f96807/e8be6/couple.jpg 1912w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>We're overdue for a date night.</p>\n<h2>What Lies Ahead</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Year, New Perspective","date":"2020-01-17","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2020-01-17/"}}
