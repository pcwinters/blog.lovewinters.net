{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>There's no place like home, which is great because we're back in ours and going to be spending a lot of time here. We've made the decision to keep our isolation going for as long as it takes or as long as we're emotionally and mentally able. I wish there was some acceptable middle ground, but I'm afraid that there's no way for us to balance the risk. Last year we almost lost a child, and, having spent many weeks without hope, I feel like it's our responsibility to protect what fortune granted. If schools re-open in the Fall, our boys will remain at home. We're picking up groceries once a month. And, we're holding all therapies over video.

I developed a cough, headache, and some symptoms after we were forced to let workers back, despite precautions. Thankfully, I started keeping my distance from Auri more than a few days ago when I noticed something felt off, but the persistent cough and low fever yesterday has pushed me over the edge and into in-home quarantine. This situation feels outrageous, but it underscores how little it would take to bring down this house of cards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"bunny.JPG\">!bunny.JPG</a></p>\n<p>So, we're back home, spending time outside, building things, and enjoying our new house.
