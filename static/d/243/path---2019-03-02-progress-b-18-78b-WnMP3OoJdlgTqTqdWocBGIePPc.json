{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've been <em>cautious</em> and hesitant to openly acknowledge how well things are going because of how fearful I've been (\"hope is the luxury of those who are unburdened by fate\"). Fortunately, however worried I've been that we may be inflating her progress has been put to rest this week. Of course, I just can't continue without adding that there's a long way to go and a lot of unknowns. But, with that said, I'd like to share that others have confirmed our observations and remarked on Auri's improvement. On Tuesday and Thursday, we've had followups with Auri's doctor managing treatment and her neurologist, respectively. Both have remarked that she's doing notably better than when they had last seen her. For our neurologist, it's been over a month, during which Auri had gotten much, much worse. To me, this represents a really strong bounce back.</p>\n<p>A little over a week ago and only just after starting her medicine, Auri was feeling better but still <a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA\">struggling to lift her head or roll over</a>. Since then, she's progressively engaging her core muscles more and holding herself up better. Day by day we see continued improvement and I try to take notes. This past week, Auri has been: extending her arms more and reaching over her head, dancing, and bouncing in the tub to make waves.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/iuPiuDXS467cBefNA\">If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a million.</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Progress","date":"2019-03-02","author":"Patrick Winters"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019-03-02-progress/"}}
